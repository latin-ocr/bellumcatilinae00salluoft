EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LXX. Inter hiberna Romanorum] Sallust either means, that Nabdalsa*s
army lay among or betwixt the Roman garrisons placed in such towns of
Numidia as had submitted to Metellus, or we must take inter to signify
hard by or near hy: a sense in which it is sometimes used: and then the.
meaning will be that Nabdals‘a's army lay upon the bon-ders of Numidia,
not fai· from the Romans, who were quai-tered in the province, as we are

told, cap. lxi.
