them the Aborigines, a witct
sort of people, without laws,
without govermnent‚ free from
the curb of authority, and
under no restraint from penal
sanctioris. After these came
into one city, though of α diffe-
rent descent‚ of α different tcm-
guoge, each living after a diffir-
ent 'man‘ner; it is incredibte to
relate, how easily they incorpo—
rated. But when their state, en-
riched with. citizens, institutions,
and territorias, seemed abun-
dantly prosper-cus, and sufficiently

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

VI. 1. Aborigines] Commentators are divided about this word.¹ *Some
few think it may be taken appellatively‚ and signify the old nafives, or
first inhabitants of Italy ς but most are of opinion, that it is a proper name
of some people, who came into Italy in the early ages of the world, but
from what country is uncertain.

2. Atius atio more viventes] That is, atius vivens lwc more, atius vivens
alio more. And hence atius in such concise expressions, because of its
partitive, and consequently plural signification, is frequently joined with
· nouns and verbs plural. Cap. xxii. Alius atii tanti facinoris conscii.

Cap. lii. Alius alium expectantes- Liv. 11. cap. x. Dum alius atium
circumspectant. Alter admits of the same construction, Senec. epistcxiv.
Haeo vitia caeteri imitamur, et alter atteri tradunt. And so of several
other partitives.

3. Bello tentare] Tentare is here put for tentabant5 a mode of expression
familiar not only to Sallust, but usual in most historians; who, to render
their periods smooth and gub, and make their lang-uage keep pace, in
some sort, with the quickness of the actions they would express, and with
the fire of their own imaginatum, generally affect the use of infinitivcs,
and neglect the indicatives as more clogged and heavy. It is needless
to adduce instances 3 the next sentence is one, presently after you have
five, and almost every chapter will afford more·
