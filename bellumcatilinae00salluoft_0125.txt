upon the reductiora of Numan-
tia, P. Scipio had determined
to dismiss the auxiliary trocqm,
and return home himself} he
brouyht Juqurtha into his own
tent, after he had loaded him
with presenls and applauses in
a pompons manner before the

ship of the Roman people in α

purchased with danqer from a
few, which belonged to many, that
ifhe would continue in his virtuous

practices, both ylory and a kinqdom would drop in upon him qs

money would fall headlonq into ruin.'

with the nemost care, that he be
the same to the senate and People
of Rome. In reqard co our
friendship, I heartily corcyram-

VIII. Publice qudm privatim] Jugurtha is here adv-ised to court the
favour of the Romans publice, i. ε. of the whole commonwealth by pub-
lic and meriturious aetions; potitis quam ριίιιοιὲηι, i. e. rather than make
application to a few leading men, and bribe them over to his interest,

in hopes of raising and aggrandizing himself through means of their in-
fluence at Rome, and iu the senate.
