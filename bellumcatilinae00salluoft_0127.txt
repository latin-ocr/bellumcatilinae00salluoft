panifz nomen familiae re-

difficillumum inter morta-
lis, glorio, invidiam vicisti.
Nunc, quoniam mihi na-
’ tura vitae finem facit, per
hanc dextram, per regni
fidem moneo obtestorque,
uti· hos, qui v tibi genere
propinqui, beneficio meo
fratres sunt, caros habeas:
neu'malis alienos adjunge-

re, quem sanguine con-
junctos retinere. Non' ex-

praesidia regni sunt, ve-

armis cogere, neque a‘uro
parare queas: officio et
fide pariuntur. Quis au-

fratri? aut quem alienum

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

2. Nomen familia: renovatum] Nomen quod comparaverat sibi Masinissa.

3. Per regnifidem] Literally is, by tlte honour of royalty, i. e. by the
honour which a king ought to have. Cortius comments on it thus per
fidem, quam in regnum acceptus debes.

4. Concordia parvae res crescunt, δια] The conduct of Scilurus is an
excellent commentary upon this. , He had 24 sons, or as some say, 80,
and, on his death bed, in their presence, called for a sheaf of arrows of
the same number, and desired each of them to try to break them; which
when none of them could do, he took >them one by one, and broke them
all to pieces before them3 designing thereby to teach them, that unanimity
would be their strength and security3 and that by division they would be
weakened, and rendered an easy prey to enemies.
