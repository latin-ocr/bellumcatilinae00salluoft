EXPLANATORY NOTES.

XLVI. 1. Perdundae reipublicae] Coi-tius is os opinion these words are
in the genitive rather than the dative, and that the construction is the
same as that of conservandae libertati atque augendoe reipublicae, cap. vi.
⁵ 2. Terracinensem] Terracina was a town in Latium, anciently called

Anxur, 'and hence the patrial Terracinensis.
