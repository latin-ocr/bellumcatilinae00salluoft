but they pretend here, that they had not enjoyed, or could not obtain the
benefit of these mitigations.

3. Faerzeratorum] These are a set of rich sellows at Rome, not unlike
the pawnbrokers in London, who lent out their money on interest or usury.

4. Argentum aere solutum] Commentators are not agreed as to the pre-
cise impert of these words. Some take argentum to be put in general for
debitum, and ecre for cerarium .· and then the meaning would be, that the
private debts of these poor people were ordered to be paid out of the
public treasury. Some again take the words to impert, that brass was made
to pass in paynient for silver, weight for weiglit. But others, with more
probability, think that there is here an allusion to the two coins as and
sescertius,· and imagine, that the discount allowed by the govermnent was
such, that a creditor to whom a sestertius (which was a silvei· coin) was due,
should be obliged to discharge his debtor upon receiving an as, which πνεῖς a
brass coin, and of far less value; and that the same proportior] of discount
was to be observed in greater sums. And Velleius Par. ii. cap. xxiii.
informs us, that Valerius Flaccus. who was Consul the year after the death
of Marius, and about ‘25 years before this time, made a laW‚ qm'ae' creditoribus
