LXXIX. But since we are
got into these parts, by the af-

negotia veni· fairs of the Leptitani5 it seems

not improper to give an account
os a noble and wonderful action
of two Carthaginians. the place
has put me in mind of it. Ac the
lime when the Carthaginians
ruled over the greatest part of
Africa, the Syrem'ans were also
a great and wealthy people. The
country in the middle betwixt
them was all sandy, and of an
uniform appearance: there was
neither river, nor ‘'noantain, lo

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

3. Ab imperio Regis] By Regis some understand the King of Persia3
but others with greater reason take it to be meant of the King of Numi·
dia, or Jugurtha: for as Numidia lay next them, they had, in a sort, by
this time become one people with the Numidians by theirintermarriages„
and therefore it is not improbable that Leptis at this time was much like
Capsa mentioned, cap. lxxxix, that is, a free city, governed by its own laws,
but under homage however to the King of Numidia.
