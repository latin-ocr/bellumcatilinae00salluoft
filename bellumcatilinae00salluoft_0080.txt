4. Haruspices respondissent] These were a reli gious order at Rome, whose
business it was to inte* ret prodigies, and foretell events by observations on
beasts offered in sacrixee. Respondissem is here a word of proper style.
Cic. i. de div. cap. xxixvi. Pater ad haruspices retulit, qui responderunt,
nz‘hil illo puero clarius fore. See Kennett, b. ii. cbap. iv.

5. In liberis custodiis] It was a compliment sometimes paid to criminals
of high birth and distinction, that they were not sent to the common prison,
but committed to the custody of the Consuls, Praetors, AEdiles, or persons
who became bail for them; and this kind of confinemcnt was called libera
custodia. ⁴

6. AEzlilis] So called ab cedibus curandis. These were magistrates, four
in number, whereof two were elected out of the commem, and were
called AEailes ]›lebis,· the other two were chosen out of the nobility‚ and
were named AEdiles curules, because they were allowed the honour of
using the sellu curulis, which was a chair of state made of ivery, on which
they sat in their ehariots. The office os the AEdiles was to inspcct the build-
ing and reparation of public edifices, such as temples, theatres, baths, §jc-
to take care the roads were kept in good repair, to rectify weights and
measures, to regulate the games and public diversions. Besides these four
AEdiles, Julius Caesar, A. U. 710, added two more out of the nobility‚ who
were called AEdues cereales, because their business was to inspect the public
stores of corn, supervise all commodities exposed to sale in the markets,
and punish delinquente in matters of buy-ing and selling.
