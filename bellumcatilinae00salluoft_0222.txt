EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LXVII. 1. An casu ita evenerit] Plutarch, in his life of Marius, tells
ug, that Turpilius was guilty of no treachery, and that his escaping at
this time was owing, not to chance, but purely to the regard the people
of Vaga had for him, on account of his lenity and gentle government.

ΞΔ. Inte-stabilisque videtur] Proprie ille est, qui nec testimonium dicere,
nec testamentum facere, aut testamento aliquid consequi potest: eoque

jure potior pars de jure libertatis continebatur.

Hinc pro homine nequam

et execrando ponitur, qui communi civium jure vitssque indignus est.
