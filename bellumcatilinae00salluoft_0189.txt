to farnish him with corn, carry
his provisions, in short to do
every thing that should be order-
ed. Metellus 'not α bit the less
for that, but equally, as if the
enemy had been at hand, march-
ed with his army in a posture of
defence, sent his sconis into att
quarters round, imagined those
tolcens of submission a sham, and
that they sought nn opportunity
to trepan him. Wnerefore he
himself, with some battalions
clear of baggoge, and a picked
bod-q of stingers and archas,
marched in the van; in the
rear took charge his iieutenant-
general C. ,Marius with the
horse.- the auxiliary horse he clis-
tributed to the two flaviles uiliter
the command of the tribunes ⁰f
the legions and the commanders
of the battalions‚ that the light-
armed foot mixed with them
might be ableto repulse the ene-
my's horse, in what quarter so-
ever they should make their at-
tack. For Jugurtha was a
man of so much subdety, and so
weit acquainted with the coun-
try and the art of war, that it

was hard to say, whether he was more dangerous, when absent
ον present, in peace or war.

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

3. (linimentum portare] commeneus proprie, quod cum agmine incedit,
exereitus necessitatibus inservit: deinde pro cibariis aliisque necessariis
positus est. Eum parati erant portare; quia levare partim milites
labore, partim jumenta volebant.

4. Insidiis locum teneare] credebat quosdam homines, illnm'illosve,
qui deditionis signa dederant, insidiis locum tentare.

5. l’ermiaeti velites] Velites in subsidium equitum inventi primum,
quod essent levi armatura, et facile illis sese adjungerent. Proprie iili
etant, qui in equos equitum insilirent, et, cum ad hostem appropin-
quassent, celei-i saltu descenderent. See cap. cv. n. 4.
