u‘tility, or to the security‚ interest, felicity, and honour of society. By
(equum, bonumque then we may understand the law of nature, which is
equally binding in all countries ; and by jura gentium, the usages estab-
lished betwixt nations by mutual consent or long custom-

7. Animum advortit] This separate way of writing these words was
constantly practised by the ancient53 but the modern writers contract
them into animadverto or animadverto. Sallust sometimes writes them
separately‚ as here and in cap. lxix and xciii. and sometimes contracts
them into animadverto, as in cap. xlviii. l, liii. lviii, lx.

8. In priore actione] Actio here signifies an action in laW, or a process
before a court, which consisted of several parts 3 such as, 1. The
summoning or citing the offending person to the court 'at the instance of
the actor or plainlgff} and this they called injus vocare. 2. The accusatio ,-
or impeaching of him before the judges. After this a day was appointed
sor the trial ; and then carne on, 5. The defensio, or exculpation offered
by the reus, or accused person, for his own vindication. 4. The dis-
ceptatio causae, or pleading of the lawyers on both sides. 5. The latio
sententiaf, or pronouncing of sentence. See Kennett, 111. cap. xvi. xviii.
xix. xx. In priore actione does not signify in a former process, but in the
former partos this process ; as the phrase in summa arbore does not signify
upon a very high trec, but upon the top or highest part of the tree. See
cap. cvii. n. i.

, 9. Vades dederat] These vades were sureties or cautioners, who, at
Jugurtha’s request, to save Bomilcar, upon his being irnpeached, from

going to prison, became bail, or engaged themselves under a penalty, he
should appear, and answer at his trIal.
