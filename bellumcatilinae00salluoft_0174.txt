Aulus Propraetor iu che camp, went for Rome.

after he went off himself, being
ordered by the senate to depart
out os Italy. But after he was
gol out of Rome, oflen looking
back to iz without speaking, he
is reported αι last to have said.-
That the city was to be sold,
and would soon be ruined‚ if
it found a chapman.

‘makes all dispatch to transporz
into Africa provisions, money,
and other things thaz were ne-
cessary for the soldiers, ond ‘went
sorlhwilh himself, that he might
finish the war by jorce of ainis,
or surrender, or by any other
means, before the electiores, which
time was not far off. But on the
other hand, Jugurtha recorded
oll, and contrived now one, and
then other ‘methods of pulling off i

render, and then again pretend ²

pushed him, and a little after ¹
corne briskly on, lest his men ·:
should be dispirited: thus he be· ;
fooled the Consul, by pulling off' ³
one while the war, another while

who al that lime thought Albinus ,
was not ignorant of the Ix'ing’s ’
‘meaning ,⁰ and could not believe,
after so much hoste, that the war l
had been protructed so easily from
carelessness, more than from de.- ⁴
