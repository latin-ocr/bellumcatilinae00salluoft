EXPLANATORY NOTES.

XXV. 1. Senati princeps] The right of creating Senators belonged at
first to the Kings ; afterwards the Consuls named them, and referred them
to the people for their approbation: but nt last the Censors ingrossed the
privilege of conferi-ing this honour. He that stood first in the Censor’s
roll‚' had the honourable title of princeps senati ,- yet the chief magistrates,·
such as the eonsuls, the Dictator, διο. were always his superiors in the
house.

2. Uticam adpulsi] A town on the coast of Africa, opposite to Sardinia,
famous by the death of Cato. It was built much about the same time with
Carthage, by a colony of T yrians too, as Justin relates, XVIII· cap, iv.
