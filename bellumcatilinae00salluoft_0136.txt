I had heard my father say, that
they, who would cultivate
friendship with you, undertook
α miyhty tash; but were of all
mankind the most secure. What
was in the power of our family
to do, it did,- ic assisted you irc
all your wars. it is in your
power, my Lords, that we be
secure in times of peace. I'Wyfa·

eouut of his hinduess, would be
united to us as a third. one of
these three is already murdered,
and I with much ado escaped
the wiched hands of the other.

our fizmz'ly are cut off: my fa-
ther, as necessity required, yielded

hinsmen : beiny taken prisoners
by Juyurtha, part of them have
been erucffied, part exposed to
wild beasts ; a few, to whom
life was lest, shut up in clun—
9eons, lead a Ιξίὲ εἵη sorrow
and mourniny, worse than death.
[f all remained entire in my
‚possessiom whe'eh either I have
lost, or of fidends are become
foes, yet, {f any chiny disastrous

persons and things,
