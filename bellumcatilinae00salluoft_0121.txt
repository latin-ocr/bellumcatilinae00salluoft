EXPLANATORY NOTES.

” 4. Imperii vimque ejus finis idem sicil] Some have taken these words to
import only, that Masinissa continued to be King of Numidia till his

death ε but this sense is trifling.

The true meaning is, that the grant of

the dominions made to him by the Romans was only during his own life,

and did not descend to his son.

Accordingly we find that Micipsa had

only that part of Numidia which ancieutly belonged to his father3 but
Cirta, and the other parts of Numidia, which had been taken from
Syphax, were, upon the death of Masinissa, reduced by the Romans into

the form of a province.

5. Allicipsafilius] Masinissa had 44 sons, or, ἃς some say, 54, of

whom three only were legitimate.

His family, as far as taken notice of

by Sallust, may be thus represented.
The sons of Masinissa were,
