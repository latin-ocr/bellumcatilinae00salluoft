EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LXIX. Capite poenas solvit] We learn from Plutarch, that Marius
was very pressing to have Turpilius put to death3 not because be thought
he deserved it, but because he knew him to be a man heartily in the in-
terest of Metellus. But as the innocence of Turpilius came, soon after
his death, to be discovered. this among other things gave occasion to the
g1·eat33,hatred which Metellus conceived against Marius. '⁵

2. Nam is civis ecc Latio erat] Though a general in the Roman army
had a very great authority, yet after the Porcian law, neither he, nor
any one else, could punish a native citizen of Rome with rods or deatli;
the highest punishment that could legally be inflicted being that of banish-
nient. But the pcople of Latium, and the other allies in Italy, though
they formed, in a sort, part of the commonwealth, and enjoyed several
immunifics, yet had not this privilege emended to them3 and therefore
they- ’ , t be sentenced to death, or other punishments, according to the
εἰμί their crime. And here further notice, that, before the Por-
δή laW‚ condemned criminals at Rome were commonly first scourged or
lashed with rods, and then put to death: accordingly we find this form
vs procedure observed here in the case of Turpilius. See cap. ii. n. 5.
