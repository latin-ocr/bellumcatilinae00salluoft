4. Ipse aliique] Cortius looks on these words as spuriouS, and thinks the

word Sulla, taken in conjunctior] with the sentence, sufficiently supplies the
place of a plural nominative to the verb itwaclunm as being equivalent to

§ulla cum suis invadunt.
5. Ad pedites convortie] ι’. e. to tlte foot which Volux had brought up,

and who, with Bocchus as their leander, were attacking the RomVs in
their rear.
