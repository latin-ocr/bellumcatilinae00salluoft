EXPLANATORY NOTES.

6. Agmen constitit] eortius, after along dissertation on the verb constitit,
concludes, that it is sometimes taken actively, and to be understood so in
this place. His words are, Nam et sisto, est stare facio, si ita loqui liceat ,-
ergo consisto est, curo ut omnes desistant ab eundo, ut onmes stent. Sic
Caes. l. Civ. cap. xli. Poleslate factd Afranius copias eduxit, et in medio
colle sub castris constitit.

7. Triplicibus subsidiis] Metellus’s army, as now ranged, consisted of
four lines; the first of which was that next to Jugurffla, and is called
prima acies, or principi05 the other three lines, that were drawn up be-
hind the first, and which here come under the name of subsidia or reserveS,
we may imagine to have been the hastati, the principes, and the triarii.

8. Inter manipulos] In forming any of the four lines mentioned just
nom there was left an empty space betwixt one manipulus and anothcr;
and these vacant spaces Metellus fills up with the archers and slingers.

9. Transvnrsis principiis] The meaning of these words may be thus illus-
trated. imagine, that, in the figure annexed to note 2. of the preceding
chapter, the length of Metellus’s army, as drawn up upon the mountain,
reached from A to B; in which position as they all stand with their
faces to the south, the right wing will be at A. and the left at B; and as
they are drawn up in four lines3 the southermost of these lines will be the
primu acies. Now imagine, that all of them, without altering their
place or station, be only made to front another way, that is to turn their
faces from the south to the east. and then in this order pursue their march
down the mountain, with their right side towards Jugurtha: by this
means, the line that made the prima acies, as they stood marshalled on the
