EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LXXXVI. l. Neque ez· classibus] Servius Tullius, the sixth King of
Rome, divided the people according to their estates or riches, into six
ranks, called classes, with a d‘esign to regulate the taxes, the form of pro-
cedure in the electiori of the magistrates, and the levying of soldiers, ac·
cording to the wealth, diguity, and order of these classes. The first classis
consisted of the richest citizens; and was subdivided into 98 divisions,
called centuriae or centuries. The second classis was next in diguity and
wealth to the first, and consisted of 22 centur-ies; the third of as many:
the fourth had 20; the fifth 50 ; and the sixth had but one. At the elec-
tion of the magistrates they began with the first classis, and collected the
votes centuriatim, οι· according to the order of the centuries in it, begin-
ning with the first: then they proceeded to the second classis, and from
that to the third, «gc. and such assemblies were called comitia centuriata.
lu much the like manner did they proceed in levying soldiers. Those of
the first classis being the richest‚ and making the greatest figure, had the
peenliar name of classici ,- and all the rest, of what class soever, were said
to be infra classem : and hence too the first-rate writers among the Romans
have got the name of classici auctores,

2. Capite censos] The sixth classis consisted of the poor-er sort of citizens,
and had very little to say in public affairs; the matter being commonly
determined before it came to their turn to vote. They were scarcely
ever listed sor soldiers except on extraordinary occasions, as being persons
who had nothing to lose at home, and therefore under tlxe greater tempta-

tion of deserting to the enemy. They were divided into two orders 3 the
