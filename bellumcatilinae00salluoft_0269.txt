his merit.- and many have made

a question of it, whether he was
more brave, or more fortunate. for
as to what he did afterwards, I am

in doubt whether it would yive me more shame or sorrow to relate it.

Marii cum equitatu venit,

multis rogantibus, aliis
per se ipse dare beneficia,

properantius, quem aes

nullo repetere: magis id
laborare, ut illi quim] plu-

ᾗ XCVI. Sulla then, as has
been said above, after he arrived
in Africa, and the camp of' Ma·
rius with the horse, though raw
before, and unaequainted with
war, became in a ¹short time the
most aceomplished of them all.
Resides, he was complaisant in·
his address to the soldiers; he
bestowed favours on many upon.
their request, on others (ff his own 7
accord, and was bachward to
receive any: but repaid them in.

yreater haste than borrowed mo·

ney; though he demanded re-
turns from none: this he rather
endeavoured, that as many as

possible should be indebted to

him: he would enyaye both in

jocose and serious conversation

with persons of the lowest rank .-
in the incanzpmentS, in the
onccrclaes, and upon the watches,
he was every where at hand:
nor did he in the mean time, as
is wont to be the way of a de-
endeavour to
lessen the character of the Con-

ever: only neither in counsel nor
action could he suffer another to be

superior to him ,· and he excelled most men. By which behavz’our,
in a short time he came to be in hiyh favour with Marius and the

soldiers.
