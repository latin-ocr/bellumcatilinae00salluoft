EXPLANATORY NOTES.

XLV. 1. Caeteris art& modum statuisse] Caeteris, quinon essent gregarii.
eis-crum servorum jumentorumque nurner‘um permisit ,· prcefinivst, quis quotque
haberet. N. B. Art& is not the ablative from ars, but an adverb, the same
with arcte.

2. Ipse cum legatis circumire] In the Roman camp watches were kept at
each of the four gates, and these were relieved every three hours; so that
there were four sets in the night. And, to keep the men on the watch
strictly to their duty, there was a circuitio vigilum, or a visiting of the
watcli, performed four times every night. This. for a long time, was the
business of the T ribunes3 at length they were allowed to execute this
piece of their office by deputies; and at last a set of meu were appointed
for the purpose, called circuitores. This circuitio Metellus and his lieute·
nants take the trouble of themselves.

3. Exercitum brevi confirmavit] Confirmat exercitum, qui eum firmum
reddit adversus hostem.
