EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LX. Ignem, alia premeret) tela ingerunt] WVhatever is thrown with the
hand is called'telam ; aud so fire, wlierewith one defends himself, or annoys
his enemy, comes also under this denomination. Liv. 1V. cap. xxxiii.
Ignibus armata ingens multitudo, facibusque ardentibus tota collucens, velut
fanatico instincta cursu, in hostem ruit.

LX l. Aut suo loco] It was observed‚ cap. liv. n. 3. that suus locus is the
same as locus sibi opportunus. Thus Liv. XLII. cap. xliii. Suo mutim&
tempore, aeque alieno hostibus incipere bellum. Horat. epod lx. v. 50.

Ventis iturus non suis.
