phanes to Jagurcha3 others sold
the ἀθεεὶ-βενε ,- part plundered the
countries that were at peace
with us, sach a fit of avar-ive,
like a plagae, had seizcd upon
their spirits. Bac Cassius, upon
passing of the bill preferred by
C. Affemmias, and wlzilst all che
nobilicy were struck wilh con-
scer-naaion, goes over to J agartha ,-
and persuades him, though sor-ely
ffighted, andfrom a sense ofgailt
despairing of his case .· ⁴ sinae he
had sar-rendered himselflo the Ro-
man people, not ιο choose rather to
make trial of their power clzan
their clemencyff Resides, he pri-
vabely engaged his own saith,
which J agai-tha vacaed no less than

hl τι of the public. such was the character of Cassius ab that time.

XXXIII. Igitur Ju-
gurtha‚ contra decus re-
gium, cultu qu’am maxu-
me miserabili, cum Cas-
sio Romam venit. Ac ta-
men etsi in ipso magua vis
animi erat, confirmatus
ab omnibus, quorum po-
tentia aut scelere cuncta
gesserat3 C. Baebium tri-
bunum plebis magna mer-
cede parat, cujus impu-
dentis contra jus et inju-
rias omnis munitus foret.

XXXIII. Whereapon Jagarcha
comes along with Cassius ιο Rome,
wilh a very sorry eqaipage,
unsuitable ιο the dignicy of a
prime. And though he had a
large sloclc of assarance himself,
and had been encouraged by acc
>those too, by means of whose
power or rogaery he had managed
the whole afficir5 yet he gains
over C. Bae-bias, tribune of the
commons, by an immense bribe,
tlzac by means of his impadence he
might be secured against justice

XXXIII. 1. Cultu qaam mamam& miserabili] It was an ordinary prac-
tice among the Romarm, sor persons accused and under process„ to wear
mourning habits, οι· to go in a very mean dress, let their hair aud beards
grow, and by all possible ways express their humility, till their trial was
over, in ordei· to move the comp-assion of the people, and theii- judges:
and it was with this view, and in compliance with this custom, that

„Iugurtha came in such a pitito} plight to Rome.
