EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LIV. 1. Igitur his genus] Mr. John Clarke, in his preface to Sallust, is ,
highly offended at the comparison here drawn betwixt Cato and Caesar;
but at the same time he frankly acknowledges‚‘that this is the only mate—
rial fault he knows in Sallust. Some of his words are, “ It is an out-
“ tage upon common sense, to run a parallel betwixt two men of such
“ opposite characters, so as to leave it at last a disputable point, which
“ was the greater and better of the two. Caesar w as indeed a person of
“ vast abilities; but then h e had nothing m him that bore any resemblance
“ of a virtue, but what was intended directly to promote the worst and
‘⁶ most wicked design that can enter into the beart of man to conceive,
“ the destruction of the liberties of his country. The generosity, easiness,
“ and clemency Sallust celebrates him for, were in him arts or tricks,
’ί practised purely with a view to acquire and secure to himself the pos-
“ session of an arbitrary power over his fellow-citizens. Shall any man be
“ accounted or styled mild and mercisul, whose insatiable thir-st after
“ power made him wade through scas of blood to come at it? He was
“ not a whit better man than Catilinc, but had a great deal more cunning,
“ and much greater abilities, whereby he at length executed with success,
“ what the other attempted only to his own destruction. Cato was a
“ brave and worthy patriot. And to compare two such men together,
“ whose characters were as opposite to one another, as black and white,

“ in the manner Sallust has done, was vile daubing, Setting a gloss upon
‘⁶ the most extreme uickednesffi to give it the air and lustre of vir.tue'

As Mr. Clarke looks upon this comparison betwixt Cato and Caesar ’
with abhorrence and indignation‚ so he brings a heavy and odious charge
against Sallust for being the drawer of it. But 1 am of opinion, that,
upon due examination, it will be found there is no just ground for such
a censure. lt is far less difficult, as well as much safer, to draw charac-
ters of men after their death, than in the time of their life. It is an
easy matter for us now, upon looking back to the history of those times,
to sce a great disparity in these two men's characters: that the one regu-
lated his behaviour by principles of virtue and honour3 that a vicious
unbounded ambition influenced and directed the conduct of the other:
> that Cato lived and died a true panim, and that Caesar aggrandized
