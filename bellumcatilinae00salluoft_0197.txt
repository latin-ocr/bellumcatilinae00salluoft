LI. Caeterum facies to-
tius negotii varia, incerta,
foeda, atque miserabilis;
dispersi a suis, pars cedere,
aiii inseqni; neque signa,
neque ordines observare3
ubi quemque periculum
ceperat, ibi resistere ac
propulsare: arma tela,
equi, viri, hostes, cives
permixti3 nihil consilio,
neque imperio agi: fors
omnia regere. Itaque mul-
tum die processerat, cuin
etiam tuin eventus in in-
certo erat. Denique om-
nibus labore et aestu lan-
guidis, Metellus ubi videt
Numidas minus instare,
paullatim milites in unum
conducit, ordines restituit,
et cohortes legionarias qua-
tuor advorsum pedites hos-
tium collocat. eornm mag-
na pars superioribus iocis
fessa consederat. Simul
orare, hortari milites, ‘ ne
deficerent, neu pateren-
tur hostis fugientes vince-
re: neque illis castra esse,
neque munimentum ulium,
quo cedentes tenderent.
in armis omnia sita.’ Sed
[ne Jugurtba quidem in-
terea quietus; circumire,
hortari, renovare praelium,
et ipse cum deiectis tentare

= omma3 subvenire suis, 110³-
, tibus dubiis instare, quos

firmos cognoverat, eminus
pugnando retinere.

LI. Βιιι the appearance of che
whole action was fall ⁰f varie-
tz'es, confused, elimat, and mise-
rables being scallered from their
own bo ly some of them fleti, ο-

where danger· overloolc any one,
there he made a stand, and re-
palsed ic: arms, weapons, homes,
rnen, enemim, and Romans were
all jambled together· , nothing
was done by conduct or command:
chance raled all. l Vherefore mach

the event was uncertain. Finac-

Aa llze same time he entreated
and encouraged his souliers, ‘ not
