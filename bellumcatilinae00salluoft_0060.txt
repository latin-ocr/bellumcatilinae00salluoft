EXPLANATORY NOTES.

5. Patres conscripti] Romulus, soon after the building of Rome, chose
out of the graver and more elderly citizenS, 100 persone, to assist him in
the administration. These made up liis senate, and were, by a solemn
appellation, called erzms, as Sallust informs us, cap. vi. But after an
'alliauce was entered into with Tatius, and the Sabinos came and settled in
Rome, Romulus enlm-god the senate by adding another hundred to it.
··And this last hundred, as being collected, and superadded to, or put in
joint commission with the former, were properly called mems consenum.
But the appellation came in a short time to be common, and was given to
all the Senators without distinction; who, in the senate, were constantly
addressed under this honourable title.

6. Patricio homini] Romulus divided his people, according to their honour
and diguity‚ into Patricians and Plebeians. The muriciam, i. e. patribus
orti, were persons of rank and quality, bore offices of state, assisted in the
administration‚ and took care of religious rites. The Plebeians or com.
mous were to plough the ground, seed cattle, and follow trades. Every
Patrician took so many of thc Plebeians under his protection, was their
couusellor or adviser in diffieult casa, their advocate in judgment, and on
this account was called their patron. aud they his cllents. On the other
hand. the clients paid a great desei-enee to their patrous, waited upon,
sorvedt and assisted them, as they were required. On some pressing
occasions they furnishcd them with money3 but this was rarely practised;
for it was thought dishonourablc for a patron to take money of his client.

7. Inquilz'nus civia] One not born in Rome, but who came to it from
the country. 'ljhis Catilinc says safiricassy, upbraidiug Cicero with the
place of his birth, which was Arpinum, a small and mean town in Ital y.
See Jug. cap. lxiii. note 1.
