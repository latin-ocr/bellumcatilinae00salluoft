your judyment, it is of force : if
passion ,qot possession, it rules,
reason avails nothinq. Illus-
trious Fathers, I have a larye

3. Item, bellis Punicis] Punicus is derived from Poem', with the like
change as punio from ρων-ια, or muni-1 from maenia .· and I’oem‘. is the same
with Phoeni, i. e. the Phoenicians, from* whom the Carthaginians were
originally descended3 for they came from Tyre, an ancient city of Phoe-
nicia. first built, says Prideaux, by the Zidonians, 240 years before Solo-
mon's temple3 and hence the prophet Isaiali, cap. xxiii. ver. 12. calls
'syre the daughter of Zidon. See Jug. cap. xix. note 4.
