EXPLANATORY NOTES.

3. Centurio primi pili] A legion, when drawn up in battle-order,
consisted of three lines, placed parallel to, and behind one another, with
large spaces of ground, like streets or avenues, between them. 'she first
or foremost of these lines were called the lzcleali, froin the spears which
they used to fight with. The middle line were the principes,- so called,
because in ancient times, before the institution of the hastati, they com-
posed the first line, and began the fight. The third or last line were the
triarii‚· so called from their position, as being marshalled in the third
rank3 they were also called pilani or pilarii, from their weapons the
pilo. Now each of these lines were ‹livided into ten manipuli, and three
manipuli, viz. one out of the lias-tati, one out of the principes, and one out
of the triani, made a cohorte by this means the legion consisted of ten
cohorts. Each nianipulus had a commancling officer, called a Centurion ,-
and sometimes two, who, according to their dignity or place of honour,
were denominated primm, secundm, tertius, «ξε. Thus the first or chief
centurion among the hastati was named Primus hastatus, and the next in

, dignity to him Secundus hastatus, «Sic. The first among the principes wa»,-

 

called Primus princeps, and the next Secundus princeps, διε. In like

i manner, the first among the triarii or piloni was denominated Primus

pilus or Primipilus, or (lerzlurio primi pili, and the next Secundus pilus, &C-
And as the other of the triarii was more honourahle than that of
the principes, and the principes than the hastati, it naturally followed,
that the centurio primi pili, was superior to all the centurions in the legion.
This officer, besides his name of Primipz'lus, was known by several other
honourable titles‚ as Dur legionis, Prcqjectus legionis, Primus centurio, and
Primus centurionum. He had the care of the eagle or chief standard of
the legion ; and hence aquiloe praeesse, is to bear the dignity of Primipz'lus.
Nor was this station only honourable, but¹ also profitable, for he had an
extraordinary stipendium allowed him: hence Juven. Sat. xiv. v. 197.
Ut locupletem aquilam tibi sexagesimus annus adferat. WVhen he left the
service, he was reputed equal to one of the equestrium order, and bore
the title of Primipilarius ‚- as those who had discharged the highest ossices
of the state, were styled even after Consulares, Censorii, Praetorii, Quescorii‚
and AEdililii. The rod called vitis was not particular to Primipilus, but
common with him to all the centurions, as being the badge of their office;
and hence vitem possere, siguifies to sue for a centurion’s place or post.
