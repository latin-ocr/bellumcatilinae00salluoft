EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LXIV. 1. Missionem rogat] By the sacramentum or military oath‚ all =

the Roman soldiers, officers not excepted„² avere bound not ιο leave the 3'.
army upon any pretence whatsoeven or absent from their duty. without ι

the special leave of the general 3 and this was called missio: of which there
were several kinds, such aS‚ missio honesta, when an old soldier was dis· ’“
charged from the service; ‘misssio camaria, when one, on account of indis-

position, was allowed to be-abse'nt from his duty3 and hence ‘such invalids‘ ,

are by Livy called milites causam-iz* ,- mismo ignominiosa, when a person was

turned out of the army by way of disgrace and punishment3 missio gra· .

tiosa, when leave was sought or granted by way of favour, as here in the -'
case of Marius. '

9. Per negotia publica] These words elegantly express the reason why .‘·
