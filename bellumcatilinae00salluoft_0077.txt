XLV. His rebus ita ac·
tis, constitutit nocte quiz
proficiscerentur, Cicero,
per legatos cuncta edoctus,
L. Valerio Flacco et C.
Pomtino Praetoribus impe-
rat, uti in ponte Mulvio
per insidias Allobrogum
comitatus deprehendant;
rem omnem aperit, cujus
gratio mittebantur: caetera,
uti facto opus sit, ita agant,
permittit. Homines mili—
tares, sine tumultu praesi-
diis collocatis, sicuti prae-
'ceptum erat, occulte pon-
tem obsidunt. Postquam
ad id loci legati cum Vol-
turcio venere, simul utrim-
que clamor exortus est3
Galli, cito cognito consi-
lio, sine moriz Praetoribus
se tradunt. Volturcius pri-
mo, cohortatus caeteros,
gladio se a multitudine de-
fendit3 dein, ubi a lega-
tis desertus est, multa pri-
us de salute sua Pomtinum
obtestatus, quod ei notus
erat3 postremo timidus, ac
vitae diffidens, veluti hosti-
bus, sese Praetoribus dedit.
