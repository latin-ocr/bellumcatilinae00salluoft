secum ipse (liu volvens,
tandem promisit, caeterum
dolo, au vere, parum com-
perimus. Sed plerumque
regiae voluntates, ut vehe-
mentes, sic mobiles, saepe

tempore et loco constituto,

veniretur], Bocchus Sul-
lam modb, modo Jugur-
thae legatum adpellare,
benigne habere, idem am-
bobus polliceri. Illi pa-
riter laeti, ae spei bonae
pleni. Sed nocte ea, quae
proxuma fuit ante diem
colloquio decretum, Mau-
rus adhibitis amieis, ao sta-
tim immutata voluntate,
remotis, dicitur secu-m ip-
se multa agitavisse, voltu
corporis pariter, atque a·
nimo varius: quae seilicet,
tacente ipso, occulta pec-
toris patefecisse. Tamen,
postremo Sullam arcessiri
jubet, et ex ejus sententia
Numidae insidias tendit.
Deinde, ubi dies advenit,
et ei nunciatum est, *jugur-
tham haud procul abesse;
cum paucis amicis et
Quaestore nostro, quasi ob-
vius honoris caussa procedit

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

CXIII. 1. Vultu corporis] The expression is somewhat singular, and
one may think corporis superfluous: but as it is to be taken explicatively‚
and in opposition to animi, it is not without its own beauty. We meet
with several such superfluities in Sallust, such aS, timor animi, virtus
animi, solis ardores, navium carinoe.

2. Quae scilicet] Nempe remotionem amicorum repentinam, quod
secum ipse solus multa agitaverit, quod vultum mutaverit.
