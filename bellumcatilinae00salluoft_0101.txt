himself upon the ruin of the public. But the case was quite otherwise
with Sallust at the time when he wrote this history, which was about the
year of Rome 703 or 704, and so about a year or two before the civil war
broke out betwixt Caesar and Pompcy3 as M. Le Clerc, in his life of Sal-
lust, makes highly probable. At this time Caesar's character was fair; he
was a man of extraordinary abilhies, of an insinuating and invincible elo-
quence, greatly beloved by the people on account of his generosity, was
ar. able minister of state, a glorious and successful general, and had not
made the least open attempt upon the liberties of his country. Sallust
could not know the secret springs or motii-es of his conduct. nor for-esee
what use he would make of his power: how then is he culpable for com-
paring Caesar with another great man of that age, and giving him the
character he really had at the time when he wrote?
