EXPLANATORY NOTES.

2. L. Sisenna] This was a Roman historiari, who flonrished in the time
of the Jugurtlxine war, and a long while after it too: he wrote several
histories‚ and particularly that of the civil wars of Marius and Sulla : but
his works are all lost except a few fragments.

5. De uxore potuit honeslizts consuli] Potuit consuli are here used imper-
sonally, and signify‚ that his own honour or reputation might have been
better consulted by him in his behaviour with respect to his wife, whom,
it is said, he used ill, by indulg ing himself· in too much intimacy with
other women. In this sense Plutarch, in his life of Sulla, seems to under·
stand these words of Sallust. Some however take tlie expression to refer
only to a dishonourable marriage he made' m bis old age with one Valeria.

4. Numquam super industriamsortunasuit] Numquam fortuna majora
illi contulit, quam ipse merueiat, omnisque suae fortunae' ipse faber fuit.
