having been kept without dis-

the new general got more vexa-

though the toteness of the elections
had shortened the time os the
summer campaign, (md he did

waiting the issue, yet resolved
‘not to entet upon the war, till
he had obliged the soldiers to

accorffing to the discipline of
their ancestors. For Albinus,
quite dismayed with the defeat of
his brother Aulus and the army,
after he had determined not to

of the summer campaign as he
was in command, in standing
