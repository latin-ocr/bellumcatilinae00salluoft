PREFACE. V

consistent meaning, one may observe thern slurred over in the
translations in such a superficial manner, as plainly discovers
the translators had been puzzled what to make of them. And
if two translations be compared together, they will be found to
differ iu many places as to the very sense; which no doubt is
owing chiefly to the different readings in the Latin copies from
which the translators made their versions. But as the learned,
judicious, and accurate Gottlieb Cornus, by comparing a great
many of the oldest manuscripts with one another, has lately,
with immense labour and painS, furnished the world with a
correct edition of the Latin, the following translation is done
from it; which, asit is a great, so it is a peculiar advantage.

And as Cortius has not only restored the writings of Sallust,
in a great measure, to their original purity, by clearing them
of many spurious interpolation& aud other corruptions, with
which for several ages they had been sullied and deformed,
but has also illustrated and adorned them by a great many
judicious comments and explications3 I have thought proper
to cul-l out the most material and useful of them, and have
added a few more, collected from other writers, which will,
in my opinion, contribute greatly to a right understanding of
Sallust. And here the reader is desired to notice, that all the
Latin notes, except a very few that have their authors quoted,
are taken from Cortiiis3 the English notes are partly gathered
from him, and partly made out from other authors. The
reader will perhaps wish that all the notes had been in
English: and this at first indeed was my design; but I found
that some few of them would not appear in an English dress
with the same advantage they do in Latin: the rest, which
make by far the greatest number, are adduced, purely to show
that I have translated Sallust in the same sense in which the
learned Cottius understood him. In both these cases, therefore,
Ι dropt my first intenti0n3 and as all the Latin notes come under
one or other of these heads, I hope the reasons given will be
looked upon as a sufficient apology for their being in Latin.

In some few editions, the ,suffla—chine VVar is placed before
the Catilinarian; which the editors have no doubt done purely
out of regard to the order of time in which they happened:
for the war with Jugurtha broke out about thirty-three years
after the destruction of Carthage, and in the year of Rome
6413 whereas Catiline's Conspiracy happened not till fifty
years after, in the Consulship of Cicero, and year of Rome
691. However, in most editions Catiline’s Conspiracy is
'placed first, as having been first written by the author, which

appears from what is said in the fourth chapter; and this is the
order Ι have followed.
