EXPLANATORY NOTES.

v 3. Pedibus in sententiam] There were chiefly three ways by which the
members of the senate signified their assent to any thing proposedin the

house.

1. Verbo, by saying adsentio. 2. Nutu et sublata manu, by nod-
ding the head, and lifting up the hand.

5. Pedibus, when the house

divided, and all those who were of the same sentiment went apart by
themselves, and then, upon numbering heads, the point in dispute was

determined according to plurality.
4. Tib. Neronis] Qui adser'vandos tantisper in custodia, dum Catilina
debellaretur, et negotium totum exquisite pei-nosceretur, censuerat.

Appian. ii. Civ. p. 450.

LI. ι. Lubidiai simul et usui paruit] Inservivit cupiditati simul et
utilitati5 ea fecit, quae cuperet, et quae vere utilia essent.
