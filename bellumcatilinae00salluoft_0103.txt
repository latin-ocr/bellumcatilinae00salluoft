3. Supplicium sumtum] Cicero caused these conspirators to be exe-cuted
in the prison, 'upon the bare sentence of the senate, without bringing the
affair before the assembly of the people (as was usual); which was after-
wards improved against him by his enemies, and brought such an odium
upon him, as Sallust hints, cap. xxii. that at the instigation of Clodius,
Tribune of the commons, hc was actually banished out of Italy, his
houses demolished both in town and country, and his goods set to sale,
but was very honourably recalled about sixteen months after. Itis related,

vixerunt, or, they Ιιαυε lived ; a soft expression used by him on this oc-
casion, instead of the harsher words mortui sunt, or, they are dead. This
happened on the 5th of December, A. U. 691·

cohort of three manipuli, and each manipulus of two centuriae. And this
was constantly the form in the Roman armies, whether the legion consisted
of a great number m· a small : for sometimes a legion had in it 6000 men,
and then each centuria had 100, and each manipulus 200, and each cohort
600. Sometimes the legion consisted only of 5000 3 and then each centuria
