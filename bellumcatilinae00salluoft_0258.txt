and men, but much more bi) the
natural wildness of the ‘coamry
about thern. For, excepting th'e
parts m'gh the town, all the rest
was waste, unculcz‘vated, in
want of water, and infested
with serpems: whose fierceness,
like that of all wild beasts, be-
comes more violent by want ⁰f
food. besides, the nature of ser-
pents, mischievous enough in
itself, is inflamed more by thirsa
than any other thing. A very
great desire of making himself
‘master of this city had seized
Il1arias5 as well sor the ,belzoof
of the war, as because it ap-
peared to be a very dffcult en-
terprise: and Metellus, to his
great honour, had taken the town ¹
of Thala, not unlilce it for si·
tuation and strength ,· except
that at Thala there were some
springs ‘not far from the u·al!s;
the Capsensians had but one
spring, and that within >the town,
all the other water they had was
from the heavens. This was
the more easily borne with, both
there, and in all the parts of
Africa, where the people being at
a distance from the sea, were cess
polished in their fashions ,· because
the Numidiam lived mostly on

” mille and the flesh, of wild beasts‚

and sought not after salt, or other

incentives to appetite .· food they had against hwnger and thir-st,

notfor last nor luxury.
