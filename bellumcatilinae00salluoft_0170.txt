enemy, according to the usage of
their ancestors, unless he disco-
vered the associaces of his vil-
lainy ,·’ yet Memmius, l say,
having a regard to honour rather
tham their rage, allayed their tu·
mults and calmed their spirits‚·

having brought Jagurtha be-

fore them, he malces a speech: ,

recounts ‘his wicked intrigues
at Rome and in Numidia ,·’ sets

forth ‘his unnatural behaviour

towards his father and his ‘bro-
thers :’ told him ‘that though the
Roman people knew by whose as·
sistance and by what instruments
he had acted, yet they inclined
to have a more evident discovery

from himself .· that if he should

discover the truth, there would
be great hope for him in the honour
and clemency of the Roman people .·

is he smochered it, that it would not save his associates5 but he
would rain himself and blas-t his hopeS.
