EXPLANATORY NOTES.

4. Decrevere] Such words or sentences, as Curtius, in clearing Sallust
of the salse readings, strongly suspected to be spurious, but could not⁴
with absolute certainty throw out, he has inclosed in crotchets or brackets
thus [‹Iecrevere]. ι

5. Gladiatoriae familioe] The gladiators were a set of wretcheS, being
mostly condemned persons, malefactors‚ captives, untoward slaves, or
other ruffiaus, who were trained up by a lanista or fencing-master, on pur-
pose to furnish diversion to the people on public days, by engagiug before
them in mortal combats. Gladiators were first introduced by D. Junius
Brutus at his father's funeral, about the year of Rome 489. And this he
did in imitation of the ancient heaffiens, who imagined the ghosts of
deceased persons were appeased and rendered propitious by human blood.
But as the Roman people were much pleased with these bloody entertain-
ment‘3‚ they'were not long eonfined to funeral solemnities, but soon be-
came common on almost all public occasions. Every great man, to in-
grauate himself with the people, would exhibit shows of gladiatorS, (mu-
‘nera gladiatoria). Julius· Ceasar, in his aedileship, presented them with
three hundred and twenty pair. Trajan the emperor exhibited uo less than
a thousand pair. See a further account in Kennet, b. v. chap. iv.

6. lfistribuerentur] There were vast numbers of gladiators at this time in
Rome. and it was thought prudent to have them separated and dispersed,
lest getting together in a body they should join Catilina.

7. Pro cujusque opibus] Prout municipium quodque gladiatores capere,
tenere, et custodire possent.

8. Minores Magistratus] The Consuls, Praetors, and Censors, were
called magistratus majores ,ο and all the rest were named Μένωνι-3, such as
the Euius, Quaestors, Tribunos, T1·iuun·ir5‚ “S-c.
