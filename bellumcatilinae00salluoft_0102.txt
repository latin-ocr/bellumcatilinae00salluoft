LV. l. Triumviros] These, so called from their number, were persons
appointed to oversee the prison, and execute the sentence of the senate or
magistrates on criminals. They were called capitales, both from the na-
ture of their office, and also to distinguish them from the Triumviri mone-
tales, who had the charge of the mir1t; and from the Triumviri nocturni,
who had the charge of the watches for preveming fire in the night.

¹2. Tullianum] Servius Tullius,

the sixth king of Rome, enlarged and

finished the public prison begun by Ancus Marcius, and in it made this
dungeon, which from his name was called Tullianum. Forum construc-

tion, see Jug. cap. xix. note 9.
