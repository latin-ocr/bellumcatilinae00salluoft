vi PREFACE.

The orthography or spelling, in a good many words of the
following Latin, besides those taken notice of in the notes, is
a little different from that which obtains in the common
editions of Sallust. This the reader must look upon, not as
casua), but as the consequence of their being conformed by
Cortius to the most ancient and authentia manuscripts. And
this edition has with such care been adjusted to that of Cortius,
not only in this, but in all other respects, that, Ι hope, it shall
be. found to want nothing of the accur-acy of that excellent
pattern. And in some few things, Ι may say, it is more perfect
and correct: for the Amabit-es of the first declension and other
doubfficl cases, are here ascertained, by having their proper
marl( placed over the final vowel, or the vowel of the final
syllable; and such Adverbs as are of an ambiguous nature, or
which a Tyro may be ready to take for Adsedit-cs or other
parts (ff speech, have the mark of the Adcerb superinscribed.
Again, several typographical esc-apes or other blunders have
crept into Cortius’s edition, which are not taken notice of
among his Ενναία .· these are here rectified from the authority
of his notes ; as the reader may see, Cat. cap. xviii. n. ⁵2. Jug.
cap. xli. 11. 52. cap. lxxxvii. n. 2. cap. xcvii. n. 5. cap. cii. n. 2.

Encouraged by the favourable reception the following per-
formance met with on its first publication, and especially by
the approbation some gentlemen of skill have on different
occasions been pleased to express, Ι have with great care
revised the whole. Some typographical niistaloes, that had
escaped observation in the first edition, are now rectified3
· several new notes are added, and some expressions in the
translation altercd; and nothing is omitted 01· neglectcd that
I could think had a tendency to improve the boolx', or render
it more useful and acceptable to the render.

I shall conclude by observing, that at Leipsic, where
Cortius’s Sallust was printed, and 111 other places of Gcrmany,
and in Helland t00, they use two kinds of points .· the one,
called pum-tamt νηιῃῆιεοηίανη, οι· tlte yreat point, is aflixetl to
the end of a complete or perfect sentence, being the sanie as
the point οι· puuctum used in Britain and Franoe, and is
always followed by a capital; the other, called punctum
minusculum, or tlte little point, is an interpunction betwixt
the (frear point and the colon or semicol072; its strength or
force being less than that of the yreat point, and somewhat
greater than those of the other two, and is known by the word
following, which always begins witha small letter, and never
with a capital. This little point, for the sake of uniforinity in
the text and version, is adopted in the translation.
