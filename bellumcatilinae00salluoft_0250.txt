EXPLANATORY NOTES.

15. Id est, dominum—*essen This imports an assuming of such an
absolute and despotic power as a master has over slaves.

1 6. Debitos a vobis repetit] Repetere est verbum eorum qui debita poscunt.

17. Histrionem—coquum‚ qudm villicum] The histriones here meant were
buffoons‚ i. e. a sort of witty fellows, somewhat like the fools who attend
doctors on the stage in this country. These the noblemcn in Rome kept
for their own diversion, and the entertainrnent of such as frequented their
houses, particularly at table; they, by dancing, singing. and pieces of
wit und drollery, kept the company meri-y. The coquus or cook was he
who dressed the victuals, and among the ancient Romans. was one of the
meanest slaves: but when luxury came to prevail, their profession rc-
quired great art and skill to please the palates of the nobles, now grown
nice aud delicate3 and instead of one or two cooks, some noblemen, in
the luxurious days of Rome, would keep fifty or an hundred, nay, some
authors say, a thousand. The villici were stewards or servants, who
took care of noblernen's estana, and had the oversight of their country
business. Now, in this degenerate time, some noblemen valued them-
selves much more upon having well accomplished buffoons aud cooks,
