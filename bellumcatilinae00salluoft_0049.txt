EXPLANATORY NOTES.

XXIII. 1. Flagitiis aequefacinoribus] Quod agit indomita cupiditae,
ad corrumpendum animum et corpus suum, flagicium vocatur: quod
antem agit, et alteri nocet, fircz'nus dicitur. Augustin. de doctrin.

Β. Censores] These were persons of the highest dignity in the state3
their station was reckoned more honourable than even that of the Cous-uls
themselves. Every fifth year they made a survey of the people, took an
account of the estate and goods oss every person, their name, their wife’s
name, the names, number, and age of ‘their children, the number of their
slaves ; and this was called censum agere. or censum habere. The other part
of their office was the censure of manners. , They had power to punish an
ilnmdrality in any person, of what rank soever. The word notare, not ’
p'unire, was used to denote the exercise of their discipline ; and the punish-
ment or censure was called* ignominia, not paena. A Senator they could
degrude and expet tlze house, which was done by striking his name out of
the rolls. The equites they punished by taking away tlte horse allowed them
at the public charge. The commons they might either remove from a higher

. tribe to a less honourable, or quite disable them to give their votes in the
assemblies, by erasing their name out of the album, i. e. the registeror
roll belonging to their century. These several ways of punishing,were
shortly expressed in Latin thus: Senatu ejicere, equum adimere, tribu
movere, in Caeritum tabulas referre. The Caerites were thevpeople of Caere,
a town in Etruria, who, for their good services to the Romans in the
Gallie war, were honoured with the freedom of the city, bnt without the
right of voting at the elections. And when any citizen was deprived of
his right of voting by the Censors, his name, as it was struck out of the
rolls of his century, so it was entered in the tabulae or regiscer of the
Gaerites. Hence too the proverb Caerite cerci digni. Hor. 1. epist. vi.
ver. 62. of those that deses-ve to be censured and lose their privilege.

The Censors, after the quinquennial snrvey, made an expiatory sacrifice
in a very solemn manner, in the name of all the people. It consistedof
a sow. a sheep, and a bun, whence it got the name of suove cazaritia.
This ceremony they called lustrum condere, and hence lustrum came to
signify the space os five years-
