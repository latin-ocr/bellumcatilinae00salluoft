EXPLANATORY NOTES.

VII. Non se luam. neque inertiae] Luxu here may be either esteemed the
dative of the fourth declension, whose termination was u among the
ancients3 or it may be considered as an ablative, and then there will be
a diversity of construction: but this is Sallust’s manner, Cat. cap. xxv,
Docta litteris, multa alia. Cap. xxxiii. Plerique patriae, sed omnes sama
atque fortunis erperles. Jug. cap. lxxxiv. Plerosque militiae, paucos

sarna cognitos accire.
52. Transversos agie] Trcmsvorsum agere, is to turn one out of his road

to the right or left3 and navis transvorso agitur is properly said, when a
skip is forced or driven out of her course, not by contrary, but by side winds.
