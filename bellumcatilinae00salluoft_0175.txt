XXXVII. At that time the

commonwealth was hideously em-
broiled by contentions among the
tribunes at Rome. P. Lucullus
and L. Annius, tribunes of the
commum, made a struggle to con-
tinue in their office, whilst their
colleagues opposed it .· which dis-
›ute mai-red the electioris of the
whole year. By this delay, Aulus,
who, we said above, had been
left Propraetor in the camp, be-
ing put in hopes either offinish-
ing the war, or extorting mo-
ney from the King by the terror
of his army, draws the soldiers,
in the month ofJanuary‚ out of
their winter-quartem upon an
expedition‚· and came by great
marches, in a severe season, to
the town of Suthul, where the
King's treasures were. Which,
though it could neither be taken,
nor behesieged, both by reason
of the roughness of the season,
and the advantageous situation
of the place: (for the plain be-
ing vriuddy had made with the
winter rain a morass round the
wall, that was built upon the ex-
tremity osa craggy mountain :) yet
either by way ojff'eint, thal he might
strilce terror into the king5 or blind-
ed with covetousness, he erects
vineae, casts up amount, and qniclcly
prepares other thingS, that were
necessary for liis enterprise.

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

XXXVII. Aggerem jacere] Aggeres were mounts or banks of earth
thrown up, and raised to such a height, that they equalled or exceeded
the height of the town-walls. From these the soldiers discharged their.
missit-e weapons upon the inhabitants, and so protected their own men
from their assauhs, till they had time to undennine the wall, or beat it

down with engineS.
