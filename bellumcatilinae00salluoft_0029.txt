cheats or rogues; andfalse in the English admits ofthe same sense. There
ase a good many adjectives and participial words of the like ambiguous na.

sense. Cap. v. profusus is used forprffundens. Nescius denotes him who
knows not, or him who is not known. Surdus is he who hears not, or he
who is not heard. Infestus and innoxius are often active, and many others.

Coneagio quasi Coniugio is in this place not the nominative, but the ab·

the vices here mentioned, were propagated‚ and became universal. F lor.
