EXPLANATORY NOTES.

2. Act urbem Imperatores erant] i. e. prope urbem ,- for whenever a
General demanded a triumph, he was obliged to resign the command of his
army ; he was not allowed to enter Rome, nor approach it but at a certain
distance, till this honour had been granted or refused him by the senate.

5. Sea-certia] Sestertius was the fourth part of a denarius, and was equal
in value to two pounds and a halfof brass; and hence in authors it is fre-
quently denoted by LLS (id est, ctztoe librae et semi), or, which is the same
in a contracted form, by HS or IIS. In numbering by sestertii, the fol-
lowing rules are to be observed.

Ι. The sestertium (neut. gen.) contained a thousand sestertii, and is
in *salue of our money about 7t. 16s. Sct. ,- so that the reward here offered,
of sestertia centum, amounts to 781t. 5s. and sestertia ducenta to he
1562t. lOs. sterling.

1 Ι. lf a numerat noun be joined with any of these words, it denotes prc-
cisely as many as the numeral expresses. Thus aecem sestertii is 10 sestertii,
and decem sestertia is lo sestertia, or 10‚000 sestertii ,· and decem sestertiz‘im
(for sestertiorum) denotes the same number.

111.1fa numeral adverb be added it raises the value loo times. Thus

decies sestertium. signifles ten hundred sestertia, or, which is the same thing,
ten hundred thousand sestertii.
