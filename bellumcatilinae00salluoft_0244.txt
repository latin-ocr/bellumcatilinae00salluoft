EXPLANATORY NOTES.

9. Beanacta mea reipublicae procedunt] The verb procedere signifies
sometimes ιο come ahroad, to come to public view ,· and so benefiaecta mea
reipublicae procellunt will signify, lisy good services to the state are displayed
in their view, or are full before their eyes, i. e. under elzeir consideration. ln
this sense Coi-tius understands the expression, who explains procedunt by
reputantur, considerantur. Marius had said in the former sentence, that the
eyes of all men were turned upon him; and now he adds, that good men
favoured him, or wished well to his interest; because when they lookecl
upon him, a train of noble heroic actions presented themselves to view,
and passed as it were in procession before their eyes. For the Construc-
tion, see Cat. cap. xxxii. n. 1. or the note subjoined to the leth rulc of
Syntax in Mr. Ruddiman’s Grammat-

3. Neque vos capiamini] Posses intelligere capiaminispe. decipiamini in
favore vestro, dum ego non is essem, qualem velletis. Sed bono jure hoc
capiamini, si ad superiora oculum vertas, ad nobilitatem, quae locum inva-
dendi quaerebat, retuleris, Duo erant, qnae Marium ad aci-isis adnitendum
impellebant, quaeque proposita habebat: primfim ne caperetur plebes ab
nobilibus, qui, si Marius male rempublicam gessisset, acerbissime in
illum simul, et plebem vindicaturi videbamur: alterum, ut ipse nobilitati

illuderet. Ex alterii parte studium, ex altera odium stimulabant.
