Hunc post dominationem
Lucii Sullae, lubido maxu-
ma invaserat reipublicae
capiundae: neque id quibus
modis adsequeretur, dum
sibi regnum pararet, quid-
quam pensi habebat. Agi-

After the tyrannio-al usurpativa
of Lucius Sulla, a very great
desire of seizi'ng the governmem
had possessed him.- nor had he
any regard by what means he
might compass that, so be he could
procare the sovereign power ιο
himself. His haughty spirit was
disquieted more and more every
day, b y the narrowvess of his for-
tune, and ω sense of guil25 both
which he had increased by those
practices which Ι ‘mentioued
above. Moreover the debauched
manners of the state sparred him
οη, which laam-y and avarice‚
vices of the worse kind, and oppo-

sice to one another, hod corrupted. ¹

Since «thie-‹masion has p'ut us in

recount the usages ofoar ane-escars

how great they left ic: how by
degrees it has been changed, and
ofzhe most glorious is become very
bad, and soamlalously vicians.
