bus quae ira fieri amat: vi-
cit tamen impudentia. Ita
populus ludibrio habitus ex
concione discessit: Jugur-

quos illa quaestio exagitabat,
animi augescunt.

sinissa: who, because, in the quar-
rel beta-ist the kingS, he had
been against Jugartha‚ when
Cirta was surrendered, and Ad-
herbal put to death, had fled out

the next year aster Bestia, was
Consul, with Q. Manicias Rufus,

thefamily of Masinissa, and since
popular odiam, with sear on ac-
count of horrid crime& bore hard
upon Jagartha‚ to 'make his suit
to the senate for the kingdom of
Numidia. The Consul, fond of
having the management of a war,
rather inclined ιο blow the coal,
