But all these things were easily
percewed by the Romans in the
dark, an'd upon the higher ground,

and gave them great encouragement.

XCIX. And RIarius being
much animated by the unslcilful
conduct of the enemy, orders α
profound 'silence to be kept ,· and
not so much as sound the trumpet8‚
as they used to do at the end of
every walch .· ancl then, w'hen day
approached, the enemy being now
wem-y, and a little before this
seized with sleep, on ιι sudden the
watches, as also the trumpeters
os the οοΙιονίε, troops, and le-
gions, all at once sounded the crum-
Ῥείη the soldiersbset up α shout, ,
and pou'red dou-n. from the camp.
The Moors and Gaetulians being
suddenly awalcened wilh the un-
expected and dismal noise, could
neither fly, nor take arms, nor act
at all, or think ⁰f any thing for
their οτι-η relies .- terror, like a
phrensy, had so slupified all os
them with the din, clamour, con-
fusion, and fright, none coming
to their relies, and our· men
charging hard. 1η short, they
were all rouled and disperse&
‘most of their arms ancl military
scandar-ds were talcen5 and
more men killed in that battle
than all the former. For their
flight was prevented by sleep and
the extraordinary surprise.

C. After this Marius marches
on, as he had begun, to winter-
quarlers ,· which he had resolved tu
talce up in the towns upon the sea(
coast, sor the sake of provisions.
