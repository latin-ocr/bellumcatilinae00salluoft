and sor a long time the rival of Rome3 till at last, about the year of =

Rome 608, it was entirely destroyed and reduced to ashes by Scipio.
The burning continued for seventeen days together; it was said to have
been twenty-four miles in compass.

5. Secundo mari] This may be explained two ways. 1. If secundus be
taken as a numeral, to signify chat witich comcs in tlte second or next place,
then secundo mari may be rendered aelze sea being near, contiguous, or leard-
ὀμ, that is, according to the English idiom, by tlte sea side, upon tke ι
shore, or, as you go along tlte shore, there is first Cyrene, ‹37⁶- 2. If secun-
dus be taken not as a numeral, but as an adjective, signisyingsavourable,
fiiir, (jv. then secundo murz· will be the same as portuosa muri, or mari
nou importuoso. But though the words will admit of either of these
senses, yet the first is that which Sallust seems to intend here, as will
appear by what is said in note 8 following.

6. Colonia leereb'n] Thera is an island in the AEgean sea, to the north
of Crete: hence leerez', leereorum, or, more Graeco, leereb'n. This
colony was sent from Thera by advice of the oracle of Delphos, under
the conduct of Aristaeus Battus3 who, upon his arriviug in Africa,
built a city, and called it Cyrene, either from the mountain Cyra on
which it was founded, or from a young lady named Cyrene, whom, upon
his landing, he found there. See the history of this at large in J ustin-
XIII. cap. vii.

7. Duae Syrtes] These are two gulphs of the sea on the coast of Africa:
the eastermost is called Syrtis major, and the westermost Syrtis minor.
Sallust describes them cap. lxxviii.

8. ΡΙιίίεηΰιι arae] Plzilen6n is also the Greek genitive, instead of
Plzilenorum. The Phileni were two brothers, Carthagenians‚ who, ιο
serve their country, condescended to be here buried alive; to the honour
of whose memory, the Carthaginians erected the altars here mentioned,
as Sallust informs us, cap. lxxix. Now these Arce Plzilenb'n were situated
betwixt Cyrene and Syrtis major, whereas our author seems to place
them to the west of both the Syrtes. But the reader must observe, that
the words of Sallust are secundo mari prima, διε. i. e. upon the shore
the places are, first Cyrene, and west from it the two Syrtes, aud Leptis
major betwixt them: then he returns again to the east, to take notice of
the places situated not upon the shore, but which were more inland;
and in the first place mentions the Arae Plzilenfin. In this sense Cottius
explains the place.
