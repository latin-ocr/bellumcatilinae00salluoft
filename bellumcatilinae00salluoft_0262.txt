EXPLANATORY NOTES.
“ XCII. l· Non eadem asperitate] 'rho meaning is, that the project was
difficult‚ nay, as difficult as the taking of Capsa3 but that the difficulties
in this case, and in that of Capsa, were not of the same kind.
ΞΖ. Inter coeteram planitiem] Inter est in medi03 atque ita evolvas, inter

planitiem, quae reliqua circa erant, si ita loqui licet. ’

ut caperet mediocre castellum.
