N umidians quiet, and not stirring
from the hill, fearing, from the
season of the year, and the scar-

wings ; οι· to speak in terms adapted to a march, neither in the van nor
rear, but in the main body, betwixt the hastati and the prima acies.

3. Primos suos proetergressum] By primos our author means that part of
J ugurtha's army which the Romans first passed by, viz. those who lay
next the mountain, as at C, in the figure of note 52. cap. xlviii„
