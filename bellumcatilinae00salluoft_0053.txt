EXPLANATORY NOTES.

XXVI. 1. Pactione provinciae] The senate always 'allotted two pro-
vinces for the new Consuls, which they commonly divided by lot betwixt

them.

The consular provinces this year were Macedonia and Gallia;

and as Antonius was fond to have Macedonia, Cicero, to oblige him, and
attach him firmly to his interest, generously gave him his cimice, and took

Gallia to himself.

Quas Consulibus in campo fecerat] As Sallust does not, say Consuli,
but Consulibus, it would seem the disappointment Catiline met with at
the electiori had put him upon a desperate resolution of cutting off not

By Campus we are to understand campus Martius,

the place where the comitia were commonly held.

XXVI Ι. ΙἾΟαπιενιενη] Camers a gentile or patrial noun, derived from
Camerinum, a town situated upon the confines of Umbria and Picenum.

2. Inagrum]

Ager, commonly rendered territory or district, was a

kind of small province or little county, denominated generally from the
¹ metropolis oriuchief town in it. We meet with numbers of them in old

Italy.

They may be compared to the pagi or cantum in Helvetia, and to
the civitates or states in Gallia. y
