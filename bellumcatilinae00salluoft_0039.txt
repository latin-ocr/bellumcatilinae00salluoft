EXPLANATORY NOTES.

that and the nones.- and so from the old verb calo, derived from the
Greek κκλῶ, to call, the first day of the month had the name of kalentine·

But this custom continued only, till the year of Rome 450. when Cn·
Flavius, the curule aedz‘le, ordered the fasti or kalendar to be fixed up in
public places, that every body might know the times and returns of the
festivals.

The nonae were so called, because, reckoning inclusiveiy, there arenine
days from them to the ides.

Τ he ides fell near about the middle of the month; and the word is
derived from iduare, an obsolete verb, borrowed from the Etrurian
lang-uage, which signifies to divide.

‚ The Greeks had no kalends in their way of reckoning, and hence the
Latin proverb ad kalendas Graecns, is used to signify a time that will never
happen: particularly AugustuS‚ when speaking of desperate debtors,
used, in a facetious manner, to say, ad kalendas Graecas soluturos, as we
leam from Sueton. Aug. cap. 87.

2. Ea: equestri ordine] The equites or Roman knights were at first no
other than the life-guards of Romulus, consisting of 500 young men, and
called celeres, a ministerii celeritate. Tarquinius Priscus afterward
increased their number to 600. But they had no authority, and made no
figure in the state till A. U. 631, when G. Gracchus, tribune of the
commons. found means to transfer the power of judging corrupt magis-
trates from the senate to the equites. This produced a remarkable change
in the government. The Roman citizens came now to cous-ist of three
orders, viz. the senatoriam equestrian, and plebeiam, and persons were
admitted into the two former according to their fortunes. One that was
worth 800 sestertia was capable of being chosen a senator-3 one that
had 400 might be taken into the equestrian order. These equites or
lcm‘glets had a gold ring and a horse allowed thcm at the public charge.

5. Er coloniis et municipiis] Coloniae were towns, states, or communi- ¹
ties, where the chief part of the inhabitants bad been trans-planted from
Rome, who, ming-ling with the natives, obtained the chief authority, and
managed the administration according to the Roman laws. Municipia
(commonly rendered free towns, infranchised towns, hanse towns, or
borough towns) were corporationis or citius, who, for their good services,
or upon other considerations, were allowed the use of their own laws, and
at the same time honoured with the immunitics and privileges of Roman
citizens. Sec Kennet, b. iv. ch. 16.
