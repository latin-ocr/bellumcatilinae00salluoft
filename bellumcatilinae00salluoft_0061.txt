EXPLANATORY NOTES.

8. Praeceps agor] Α figurative expression, taken probably from the
punishment called affectio de Tarpeia rupe, where the criminal was pushed

headlong from a precipice.

9. Ruina restinguam] A metaphor taken from houses on flre, where,

the flames being so violent that they cannot be extinguished in the ordinary
way by· water, the neighbouring houses are pulled down, in order to put
a stop to the burning.

XXXII. l. Insidiae Consuli procedebant] We might here suppose
Considi governed by factae understood. But there is no occasion for
beIng so nice, for it is nothing strange to see a substantive noun governing
a dative. Jug. cap. vii. Qui tum. Romanis Imperator.
Benefacta mea reipublicae procedunt.
Senec. Rebus Immanis Praescs.
hostis.

2. omnnium factum credens] ι’. e. Credens exercitum augere, (ξε. esse
optumum factum.
