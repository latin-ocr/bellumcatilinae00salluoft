EXPLANA TORY NOTES.

3. Sullae vinctus traditur] Plutarch informs us, that Sulla was so
proud of his success in this affair, that he caused to be made for himself
an annulus sig-notorius, or sealing ring, on which was represented
Bocchus delivering up Jugurtha'to him. But this piece of vanity in*
Sulla gave great offence to Marius.

CXIV. 1. Advorsum Gallos] or rather advorsum Germanos ; for those
here meant were the Cimbri, Teutoni, and Tigurini, a very numerous
people, being upwards of 800‚ooo, going about in quest of new
settlementS. They had sent to the senate at Rome, desiring they would
give them some land, but were refused; as we have the history in
Flor. Ill. cap, iii. Repulsi igitur, quod nequiverant precibus, armis
petere constituunt. Sed nec primum qmclem impetum barbarorum Silanus,
uec secundum Manlius, nec tercium Coepio sustinere potuerunt. Omnes
jugati, exuti castris. Actum erat, nisi Marius illi seculo contigisset.

2. Illique et inde] Illi, i. e. Itali. The reference of illi to Italia is
the same as that of qui to Africa, cap. lxxxix. n. 3.

5. Cum Gallis pro salute] About the year of Rome 564, the Gauls
took and burnt the city3 which struck such a mighty terror into the
Romans; and filled them with such dreadful apprehensions of the
Gauls, that sor several ages after, even down to the days of our
author, the Gallie name was more formidable to them than that os any
other natiou wliatsoever.
