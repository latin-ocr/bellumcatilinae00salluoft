ni studium reipublicae om-
nia superet: opes factio-
nis, vestra patientia, jus
nullum3 ac maxume,
quod innocentiae plus pe-
riculi, quam honoris, est.
Nam illa quidem piget di-
cere, his annis xv, quam
ludibrio fueritis superbiae
paucorum3 quam soede
quamque inulti peiierint
vestri defensores3 ut vobis
animus ab ignavia atque
socordia corruptus sit: qui
ne nune quidem, obnoxiis
inimicis, exsurgitiS‚ atque
etiam nunc timetis, qui-
bus decet terrori esse. Sed
quamquam haec talia sunt,
tamen obviam ire factio-
nis potentiae animus subi-
git. certe ego libertatem,
quae mihi a parente tra-
dita est, experiar: verum
id frustra, au ob rem faci—
am, in vestr& manu situm,
Quirites. Neque ego hor-
tor, quod saepe majores
vestri fecere, uti contra in-
jurias armati eatis. Nihil
vi, nihil secessione opus:

pearing on your side, did not mu
zealfor the public interest sar-
mount ευε77] thing: I mean the
power of the faction of the no-

bility‚ your tame submissam no
justice to be had3 and above aec,
that honesty has more danger than
honour attending it. For indeed
it galls me to vetate, how these
fifteen yeats you have been a
sport to the arrogance osa few,-

how basely, and how unrevcnged
your patrous have perished,· how
nour com age is destroyed by stoth
and indolence: who stir not in
your own defence, even now,
when your enemies are at your
morey, and even yet are afraid of
those, to uhom it becomes you, to
be a terror. But tho’ these things
be so, yet my mind Ρ7ο7ηρίε me to
malco a stand against the power of
faction. at least I will use the li-
berty, that has been bequeathe'd to
me by my father: bac, Ο Ro-
mans, it ties in your power,
whether Ishalt do it in vain, or
to advantage. I do not advise,
what yoar forejathers oster} did,
to rise ih ae ms against the injustice
done you. There· zs no occasionfor

violence, or separation.- they must
needs go to rum by their own

necess e est,
more praecipites eant.

called Quirinus, i. e. hastatus. Romulus, his supposed son, got the
same name, and the Romans were called Quirites But others, with a
greater show of probability say, that Romulus, upon his union with
Tatius, and the Sabines coming to dwell in Rome, did, to prevent ani-
mosities among his citizens, on account of their being of different nations,
assume to himself the name of Quirinus, and called anthe people Quiritem
borrowing the word from Cares, the chief city in the country of the
Sabines.1n much the same manner, and for the like reason, the Scots
and English were by King James VI. upon his being made King of
England, called by the co nmon name of Britons auod their countries

lenominated Souzh and North Britain.
