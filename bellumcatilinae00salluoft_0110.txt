EXPLANATORY NOTES.

6. Tribunus] The tribuni militum were offioers, of whom at first there
were three in each legion : but were afterward increased to six. They
were judges of controversies in the army, visited the watch, took care
of the works of the camp; they had the honour of wearing a gold ring,
in the same manner as the equites. Their office being esteemed very
honourable‚ was much coveted; and therefore, to make way for the
promotion of as many as possible, their command lasted but six months.
See Jug. cap. xlv. note 2.

7. Praefectus] There were many kinds ofpraefecti ; but when Praefectw
is put simply by itself‚ as here, without a restrictive or explicatory word
joined with it, then generally it denotes the Prcefeclus auxiliarium cohor-
tium atque sociorum, which was a station much of the same honour and
command among the auxiliaries aud alnes, as a tribune among the
legionaries.

8. Legatus] The Legati were next to the General in power, and used
to command, by his appointment‚ some part of the army in the day of
battle, and the whole in the General’s absence. There were several of
them in an army, and the General commonly used them as his counsenors
or advisers in·all cases of importance or difficulty.

9. Praetor] See cap. xix. note 2.

LX. l. Ferentnriis] The Fer-antarii were light armed soldiers, who
before the institution of the Velizes, used to begin the battle, with the
pila and other missive weapons. They were so called, quod ea serrem
quae in laoslemjacereneur.
