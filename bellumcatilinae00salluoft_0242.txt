5. Belli usum, aut studia volgi amissurus] The nobility imagined, the
people would be backward, and not incline to inlist for the service; and
that Marius, if he should go without them, would not be able to carry ou
the war to any purpose, and so would miss the riches, reputation, and tri·

people to inlist‚ and go with him, contrary to their iiic-lination, he would
lose their affections, and consequently his popularity, for which he was
now so famous, of which he was now so proud. and on account of which

he was so much hated and envied by the nobility.
