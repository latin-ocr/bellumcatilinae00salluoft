Neque litteras Graecas di-

language is not police, say they:
I make not that my business ,- vir·
tue without words shows itseff
sqfficiently: it is they that have
need of art to palliate cheir fpul
actions with flowers of rhetoric.
Again Ι have not scudied the Gre-
cian literature: I had 'no incli-
naaion to study it, since it hath
contributed nothing to fortitude
in the teachers of it. But I have
been instructed in those things
that are by much the most useful
to the commonweacth: to moal
an enemy, to keep an army in a
posture of dqfence ,- to dread no·
thing but an infamous character ,-
to bear cold and heat alike5 to
lodge upon the ground3 and en-
ἄπιτε, at the same time, hunger
and fatigue. With these cessans
shall I animate my soldiers ,- ‘nor
shall I treat them hardly, and
myself with indulgence ,- nor
make their toil the matter of my
glory. This is the command that

EXPLANATORY NOTES.

10. Ρανιὶνη id facio] Propria notione intellige, ut frequenter in sermone
negligentiore, quem noster hic studiose quaesivit, pro non id ego ago,
nimirum, ut verba mea sint composita.

11. Ad virtutem doctoribus nilzit prffuerunt] The Greeks were now a
conquered people, and had submitted to the Romans; and hence Marius
concludes, though very unjustly, that there could be no excellency in the

, Grecian literature, since it had not inspired the Greeks with contage and

fortitude, which is his sense of the word virtutem, sufficient to protect
themselves, aud defend their liberty.

12. Praesidia agitare] Cape, ιιιειιρῐὲ, cap. lv.

Ubi frumento, aut pabulo

opus erat, cohortes cum omni equitatu praesidium agitabant, i. e. praesidio

erant fru mentantibus.

13. Gloriam meam laborem illorum faciam] Que fere miserrima est con-
ditio militum, qui laborant, feriunt, caedunt, caduntque3 dux gloriam
rapit: illis praeter vulnera aut mortem nihil fit reliqui.

14. Supplicia cogere] Pceru's acerbissimis ad officium suum cogere.
