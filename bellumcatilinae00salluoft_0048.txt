EXPLANATORY NOTES.

XXII. l. Vino jaermioecum] The ancients called this kind of potion

offiralum.

2. Post exsecrationem] Exsecratio was the pronouncing of a solemn

oatli, wherein they bound themselves under heavy imprecatione and
cmseS, to secrecy and mutual fidelity. Liv. X. cap. xxxv iii. Jurare
cogebatur diro quodam carmine in exseciationem capitis familiaeque et
stirpis composita, nisi isset in praelium, quo imperatores duxissent, et siipse
ex acie fugisset, aut si quem fugientem vidisset, non exlemplS occidisset.
Just. 111. cap. iv. Gravissima se exsecratione obstrinxerunt, non prius,
qitcim M εςεεηαπι expugnassent, reversuros.
