of the few grandees: the nobi·
city being guilty, and therefore
under terrible apprehensions, op·
posed the proceedings oj'theGracci,
sometimes by vneans of the allius
and people of Latium, some·
times by the Roman knights,
whom the hopes of parmership
had drawn off from the interest
of the commotis: and first they
cut off by the swerd szemlus,
and men, α. few years. after,
Caius entering upon the same
course, the one a tribune, the other
one of the three commissionem
for planting colonies, as also
M. Fulvius Flaccus. And in·
deed the spirit of the Gracci,
from a keen desire of success,
was ποι kept under due regula·

preferable to be baſjled, than
triumph over ill usage by wicked
vicasures. W herefore the nobi-
city improving this success, ac-

by sword or banishment; and
rendered themselves more terrible
than powerful for the future.

other at any rate, and wreclc
their vengecince too rigorously upon
the vanqaished. Βιιι Ἰ] 1 should

the city, particularly, or according

to their fall emtent, time would fail me sooner than matter. W'here-
