EXPLANATORY NOTES.

2. Tognlorum'] By Togata· we are to understand the Romans, whose
distinguishing habit or dress was the toga ς and hence, Virg. Ι. AEneid. v.
286. calls them gens togata. The Greeks, on the other hand, were called
Pauiaei, from the pallium δι’ cloak they used to wear. Now, in all the
Roman provinces, there generally were a good number of Romans, either
merchants, travellers, or persons otherwise employed3 and those in Cirta
at this time took part with Adherbal against Jugurtha.

5. Vincis] The vinsae were a kind of wicker boxes, covered over above
with hurdles, under the shelter whereof the soldiers would advance to the
very walls, and undermine them.

4. Turribusque] Turres, or turrees, were structores of wood, in a square
form, equal in height to the walls, or a little higher3 they rolled upon
wlieels fixed below, within the planks‚ and were pushed forward by men
behind them. Within they were filled with armed men, well prepared to
annoy the besieged in every shape.

5. Velle et censere] Velle proprie populus discebatur, censere senatus,
Sed illud etiam, etsi raro, de senatu dicitur.
