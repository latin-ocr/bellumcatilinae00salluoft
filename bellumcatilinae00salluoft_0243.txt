J UGURTHA. CAP. LXXXV.

non paullum oratione suz‘i
Marius arrexerat. Nam
postquam, omnibus, quae
postulaverat, decretis, mili·
tes seribere volt, hortandi
caussa simul, et nobilitatem,
uti consueverat, exagitandi,
concionem populi advocavit.
Deinde hoc modo disseruit.

and other conceils of this kind,
and BIarias, by a speech of his,
had noc a time raised their expec-
taciens. For when he resolved
ιο levy rem-aits, every thing being
vocea sor him ιΙιαι he had desit-ed,
he called an assembly ofthe ρεορίσ,
with dessign αι once ιο encourage
them, and, as his manner was, ιο
inveiglt against the nobility. And

then he harangued them in tlze following manner.

LXXXV. ‘Scio ego,
Quirites, plerosque non
isdem artibus imperium a
vobis petere, et, postquam
adepti sunt, gerere: pri-
mo industrios, supplicis,
modicos esse; dehinc per
ignaviam et superbiam aeta-
tem agere. sed mihi con-
tra ea videtur. Nam quo
universa respublica pluris
est, quam consulatus aut
praetura, εό majore cura
administrari, quam haec
peti debere. Neque me
fallit, quantum cutn max-
umo beneficio vestro ne-
gotii sustineam. Bellum
parare, simul et aerario
parcere3 eogere ad mili-
tiam, quos nolis offende-
re3 dorni forisque omnia
curare3 et ea agere mter
invidos, occursantis, sac-
tiosos, opinione, Quiri-
tes, asperius est. Ad hoe,
alii si deliquere, vetus no-
bilitas, majorum facta for-
tia, cognatorum et adfini-

LXXV. ‘I am sensible, 0
Romans, that most men do not
make application ιο you for pre·
ferment in the state, and behave
in it, after they have compassed
their design, under tlte same cha-
racter.- αι first they are indas-
trious, Ιιανηὸιε, and modest ,- aster-
wards they lead a life of sloth and
pride. buc ιο me the quite reverse
of this appears reasonable. For
how much tlte whole common·
wealllz is of more consideration
than a consulate or proecorship,
with just so much the more care
ought its interest ιο be minded,
than these sougkc after. N or am
I insensible, what a weight of
business, by your great leinaness, I
have the charge of. To make pre-
parations for the war, and αι tlte
sometime ερατ-ε the treasary3 ιο
compel those ιο the service, whom
you would ηοι incline ιο (lisoblige;
ιο ealce care of every thing αι
home and abr-oad5 and ιο do this

cult beyond common persuasio-n.

Sed mihi id, quod esc contra ea, videtur.
