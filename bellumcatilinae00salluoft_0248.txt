on this head sor cm argument oJ‘

no speech can hurt me. because a
true one must needs speak well of

upon 'me the greatest honour, and
business of the highest impona-nce,-
consider again and again whether
this is to be repented of. Ι cannot,

other military boons,· and scars too

'EXPLANATORY NOTES.

7. Hastas, vexillum, phaleras] These were rewards commonly given
by a general to such of his men as had signalized themselves in any action.
The hasta was a fine spear of wood, without any iron on it, thence called
hasta pura: such a one as Sylvius is represented to lean upon, Virg. AEneid.
Vl. v. 760. Pura juvenis qui nititur hasra. The vexillum was a standard
curiously wrought, and'of valuable materials. The plzalerae were of two
kinds3 one being a suit of rich trappings for a horse3 but whether these
trappings were applied as an ornament to the horse’s sore-head, to the
sides of his head, or to his breast, authors are not agreed. The other
sort cf plzaterae was worn by men, and is supposed to have been a collar
or chain of gold that surrounded the neck, and hung down upon the bre-ast.
Resides these, many other military rewards were in use among the -Ro-
mans, such as the torques, armillae, patene, and the coronae of various
kinds.

8. Cicatrices advorso corpore] Scars or wounds on the breast, or forepart
of the body, were honourable, as being received with the sace to the
enemy3 but wounds or scars on the back, were disgracet'ul, as signifying that
the person was a cowmd, and had received them whilst he was running
away.

9. Relicta, ut illa illis, sed quer] Relicta, itta, and quae, are plural and
neuter, referring to imagines and nobilitas. .
