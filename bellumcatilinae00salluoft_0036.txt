EXPLANATORY NOTES.

2. In extremis terris] In Pontus and Armenia, carrying on the war
against Mithridates and Tigranes.

3. Consulatum petundi magna spes] Every one was not at liberty to stand
candidate for this high office: and probably there was something in Cati·
line’s case which dis ualified him at present, and which he was in hopes of
getting removed, an so be in a condition to set up for the consulate. This
conjecture is strongly supported by what is said to this purpose in cap. xviii.

XVII. 1. Kalendas Janias] The Romans had three remarkable days iu
each mouth, from which all the rest were denominated and computed, viz.
the Kazanes, Nemes, and Ides.‘

111 every month the first day was called kalendae. In the months March,
May, J uly, and October, the seventh day was called nonae, and the fifteenth
idus. But in all the other months of the year the fifth day was called
none, and the thirteenth idus. ¹

In reckoning, they went backward in this manner. The day preceding
the kalends, nones, or ides, was called pridie kalendas, or pridie kalendarum.
pridie nonas or nonarum, pridieiclus or iduum. The day before this was called
tertio kalendas, nonas, iaus, i. c. tertio die ante kalendas, nomm, ictus, reck-

,oning inclusively: or it was expressed thus, certio kalendarum, nonarum,
uuum, i. e· certio die kalendorum, ἃς.
