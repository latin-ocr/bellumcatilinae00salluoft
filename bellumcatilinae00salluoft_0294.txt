CXII. 1. In potestatem habevet] See Cat. cap. xix. n. 5.

2. Non 3υᾶ ignavia] The Romans were not fond of redeeming cowards;
such were osten left ιο the mercy of their enemies: but persons who, in
the service of their country, had become prisonem, not thro' their
own cowardice or mi=conduct, but the treachery of the enemy, were
ransomed by them at any price: and this Jugurtha well knew.
