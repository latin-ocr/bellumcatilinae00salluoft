EXPLANATORY NOTEs.

XXVII. 1. Tribunus plebis designatus] In the year of Rome 260, the
commotis having been much discontented for a long time before, at seeing
the nobility possessed of all the wealth and honours of the republic, and
themzelves loaded with all the toil, insisted upon having magistrates chosen
from among themselves, who might secure them from the oppression of the
senate and nobility, and accordingly the tribuni plebis were created. At
first only two were appointed, afterward five, and at last ten. By the
creation of these officere, the power of the senate was very much limited;
for under pretence of maintaining the liberties of the people, they approved
or rejected, at pleasure, the decrees of the Senate and Consuls‚ and of all
other magistrates, except the Dictatore. When the Tribunes approved a
decree, they subscribed a T,· and when they disapproved of it, they wrote
the word veto or vetamus, to forbid or prohibit the execution of it. The
persons of the Τ ribunes were by a law declared sacrosancti, or sacred and
inviolable. They had a kind of beadle, called viator, who walked before
them. In all the plebiscita, or ordinances of the people, the Tribunes
were obliged to be unanimous, at least not to dissent3 for if but one of
them oppos-ed the ordinance, it was rendered ineffectual. And hence
J ugurtha, by means of the Tribune Baebius, got clear of the inquisition
proposed by Memmius, cap. xxxiv. These Tribunes were sometimes ex-
travagantly imperious. They would assemble and dismiss the Senate, im-
prison the Consule, and were frequently the cause of many dangerous tu·
:nult53 and hence they are called by some authors pestes reipuhfz‘cae and se-
uitiosi magistratus. They were laid under great restrictions by Sulla, in-
samuch that their power wa5 much impaired‚ nay almost quite abolished.
But this tribunicial power was again restored by Pompey, as we learn
from sallust, Cat. cap. xxxviii. They were both elected and entered on
their office before the Consuls; and, during this interval, were, like
them, called a'eszgnuci. See Cat. cup. xviii. n. 2.
