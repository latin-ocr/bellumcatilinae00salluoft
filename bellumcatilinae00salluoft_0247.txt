they are much mistaten, who ex·
peet at once two things of a very
different natare, the pleasare of
sloth, and the rewards of virtue.
Α nd when they harangtte too before
you, or in the senate, most of their
speech they spend in celebrating
their ancestors3 they think them-
selves the more illustrioas for re-
latz‘hg their heroic actions .· whereas
z‘t is quite otherwise. For the more
illustrabas the lives of the former
were, so much the more scandalous
is the spiritless behavz'our of the
latter. And indeed the caseis thus:
the glory of ancestors is α light
upon their postet-ily, that suffers
neither their good nor ill qualities
to be concealed. I labour under a
defect in this respect, Gentlemen ,-
but I can relate my own actions, α
thing that is much more gloriolas,
Now see how unreasonable they are.
What they challenge to themselves
from the brave exploits of others,
that they don’t allow me from ‘my
own .· forsooth, because I have ‘no
statues to show, and because my
‘nobility is of tate date ; which
certainty to have acquired is better
than to have disgraced after re·
ceiving it from ancestors. -Ιπ-
deed 1 am ‘not ignorant, that they
would find plenty of elegant and
polite language‚ ‘tf now they had α
mind to make a reply. But whereas
upon all occasions, since Ι came
to be possessed of this high dignily
by your great favour, they abuse me
and you too with vile reproaches,
