iv PREFACE.

Sallust, but none that 1 know of has ever attempted a literal
one. VVhether this be owing to an apprehensimi, that a literal
version is a dress too mean and sordid for such a great.
historiari, or to the difficulty of the task, (for difficult it is, as
any one, by trying to translate but two or three chapters in
this manner, will soon be convinced of,) or whether it has been
thought, that Sallust was not to be read by boys, till they had
gone through a good many other authors, and acquired a con—
siderable skill m the language, and that then a free translation
would serve their purpose· which of all these, or whether any
of them, be the true reason why we have not hitherto had a
litexal translation of this author, Ι shall not pretend to detel-
mine. But as he is an author commonly taught in sch ools, I
cannot but think it a piece of good service done the public, to
accommodate him, as much as possible, to the capacity of
youth: and it is with this view Ι have made out the following
translation3 which is not, I acknowledge, precisely or strictly
literal in every sentence3 and indeed it was impossible it could
be so ; for the Latin idiom differs so widely from the English,
and particularly in Sallust, whose Latin is truly pure and
classical, that a great many sentences cannot be translated
literally, and at the same time such a measure of justness and
propriety in the style preserved, as the English may bear a
reading, and not appear absolutely stiff and barbarous. Ι ma'y
however affirm, that it is more litei-al, and consequently better
adapted to the use of learners, than any translation of Sallust
yet published : and in this I am supported by the testimony of
several gentlemen of skill and judgment, who took the trouble
to examine it carefully, and to whom I am obliged for several
amendments. Sometimes, to render the sense 'more clear, or
the English more smooth, I found it convenient to insert
words in the translation that have none to answ'er them in the
Latin; and these are in a different character.

Resides what I have already observed, there is another con-
sideration that makes a new translation of Sallust necessary;
and that is, all the translations hitherto published, are done
from very faulty and incorrect editions of the Latin. Sallust
has suffered prodigiously, and has been strangely ahusetl,
through the ignorance and carelessness of commentatore and
transcribers. The blunders and corruptions that have crept
into the text are very numerouS‚ and several of them very
gross, and different too in different copies; insomuch that, if
you compare two copies of different editions, you will find
very few chapters exactly agree. These corruptions in the
original must of course occasion blemishes and impet-sections
in the translations formed from them3 and as several of the
false readings in the Latin are such as scarcely admit ot* any
