EXPLANATORY NOTES.

5 Capto Syphace, 8.οἸ , Svphax and Masinissa were both kings in
Numidia, but reigned' in different parts of it. The suljects of Syphax
were called lilasoesulz, and their capital was Cirta. Those of Masinissa
were the Massyli. But both these nations are better known hythe name
of Numidiam, which was common to them. Their principa} strength
consisted* in their cavairy; they always rode without saddies, and some
even without bridles; and hence Virgil, AEn iv. ver. 41. calis them
Νωηίάαλ Itzfroeni. Syphax, in the beginning of the second Punic x· ar,
sided with the Romans; but afterw ard upon marrying the funons
Sophonisi a, the daughter of Asdrubal the Cartharrinian, he changed sides,
and joined the Carthaginiaetns. Gala, the father of Masinissa, had, some
‚ears before this, entered into a war against Syphax ; the. consequence of
which was, that. Masinissa, after his father's death, which happened soon ,
after the commencement of the war, was reduced to the brink os ruiti,
beina several times driven from his kingdom, destitute of forces, money,
and ³almost 311 things else. However, during the course of this war,
wherein he had been obliged to ,fly from province to province, he went
over to Spain, where he had an interview with Scipio, asteruard called
Africanus, a-nd declar ed for the Romans. To this honourable alliance he
eser after adhered with 11. e utmost zeal and constancy. Vthn Laelius
3ϊϊὶνειΓ in Africa, Masinissa joined him with a few horse; his missortunes
would not permit him to bring great succours to that Gener-al Soon
after this, a great battle was fought, wherein Syphax was defeated, taken
prisoner by L· lius and Masinissa, brought in chains to Scipio, carried
afterw ¹ard to Rome, made to adorn the triumph, and was then ciapt iu
prison, and starved to death for want of food, as a just reward os his
treachery. Masinissa, the victor, besieged Cirta his capital, and took it.
but he met with a greater danger in that city than he had saced in the
fie1d; an d this was Sophonisba, whose charms he was unable to resist3
and therefore forthwith married her; but, a few days aster, was obliged«
to send her a dose of poison as her miptial present, this being the only way
left him to keep his promise with his queen, viz. not to deliver her up ιυ
the Romans. and to satisfy Scipio, who was highly displeased with the
mar rihige Sophonisba swallovs ed the deadiy dose, and expired. After
the ςυςοιιά I’unic war, Masinissa was favoured until his death nith an
uninterrupted series of prosperity. Scipio, as a reward of his good
services, not oniy restored him his own kingdom, bnt added to it, during
his life, that of Syphax his enemy3 so that he became the most povs ersul
prince in 311 Africa, 'his domi'nions extending from Mauritania as sar as
C, rene. He was blessed with the greatest health and vigour of consti-
tution, aad rit-td to upwards of ninety years of age. He died about 3
year b‘eibre ¹the destruction of Carthago: and much about the same time
died at Rome, Cato the renowned moralist. See the lise of this prince
