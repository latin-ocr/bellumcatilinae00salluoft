ΤΟ insist upon the character of Surum, as a great genius
and a fine historiam is none of my desigm his works speak
sufficiently for themselves, and have long since procured him
such reputation amongst the learned, as sets him far above the
need of any encomiums of this kind. All Ι now propose is,
to eive some short account of the following translation; and for
this purpose it will be necessary to observe‚ that translations
are of two kinds, the one free, the other lileral or ver-bal,

'In free translations, the thing· chiefly considere'ss, is the
sense or thought of the author-3 which the translator
endeavours to express in a just, clear, and elegant manner,
without much regard to the precise meaning of every indi·-
vidual word in the original. It is the business of such a
translator accurately to convey his author's ideas, to keep up
his spirit and fine turns; to instruct, affect, and charin his
render, in the sanie manner as his author would do one who
thoi-onghly understands the language he writes in; but he is far
from being obliged to have words in his version that shall
answer and explain every single word in the original. And
such translations of the Classics may be of'excellent use to
those who (lo not understand Latin, and yet want to acquaint
themselves with the history given us by the Roman authors.
They may too, I grant, be a considerable help to such as are
applying themselves to the study of Latin, provided the student
be not a mere novice in the language; for in that case a free
translation is absolutely unfit, and can be of no manner of
service. A learner, in order to receive any benefit from such
a translation, must at least have before-hand a pretty general
acquaintance with Latin words, and the nature of the language;
and even after he is thus prepared, he will find abundance of
difficulty still behind3 for the liberty taken of departing from
the letter of the Latin, in order to make the English smoo‘th
and elegant, frequently renders the version either so general or
figurative, as leaves the learner much in the dark, nay, often
altogether at a loss, as to the proper import of the Latin
expressions: and a little experiente will convince any one,
that a translation of this kind cannot be near so helpful to·
a learner, as a litei-al one will.

For, ini a le'cerczl translation, the Latin is rendered word sor
word into the English, or the sense and meaning of every
word in the original is expressed in the translati0n; audit must
be much easier for a boy, or any body else, to come at the
¹meaning of a Latin author by such a help as this, than by one

ef the former kind. We have several free translations of
