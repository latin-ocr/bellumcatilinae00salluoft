EXPLANATORY NOTES.

CIX. 1. Ambo in sua castra digressi] Commentators are much divided
as to the meaning of this expression: some take ambo to refer to Bocchus
and Sulla‚- but Cottius is positive that Sallust means Aspar and Sulla.
Some again take castra to signify the camp of Bocchus. and that formed

, by Sulla and the party who came along with him; which two camps we

may suppose to have been at no‘great distance from one another. But
Cottius will have it, that (xe tw'o camps here meant are, the one that of
Jugurtka, which was a good way off, as may be gathered from cap. cxii,
since it took Aspar eight days in going to it and returning back; and the
other that of Marius, in and about Cirta, which are still at a greater dis-
tance: and he takes digressi to import, not that they actually went, but
that they partcd for, οι· as if they had been resolved to go to their respec—
tive camps-

2. Smtctus———et esc sententia] This construction is elegant, and
very much a-kin to utilia, aue benevolentiae, cap. ciii.
