in whom α good man ever com·
mendect bat her beauty ,· because
she scrupled to marry him, for
sear os -hz's son, now at ‘man's
estate,· it is believed for certain,
that he made an empty house sor
the impious match, by murder-
ing his son. thz'ch thing, to
nze indeed, seems chiefly to have
been the reason of his hastenz'ng
on the plot. For his pollatect
soal, at enmz'ty with gods and
men, could neither be qaieted by
watching nor rest: a guilty
conscience so harrassed his dis·
tracted mind. Accordingly his
complexion was pale, his eyes
ghastly, his gait sometimes quaele,
sometimes stow: there was a
furious witdness in his face and
countenance throughout.

XVI. Now he trained up the
youth, whom he had sedaced, as
we said above, to crimes, by
various methods. From among
them he farnishecl out false wit- ‘-
nesses, and signers of forged
deeds; taught them to set light
by their honour, estates, and
danger3 afterwards, when he
had rabbad off any regard they
had to character and modesti),
he enjoined them other greater
villainies; if⁴ an occasion of do-
ing 'mischief did not offer at pre-
sent, nothing the less of this, he
set thern on to wass-lay and
murder those who had? done him
no injary, as ‘much as {f they
had, that is, lest their hands .
