EXPLANAII'ORY · NOTES.

3. Sarcinas colligere] It was usual, before engagiiig in battle, to bring
all the baggage together into one place, and set a guard over it.
4.,Signum ant ‚imperinm ullum] Signum in this place either denotes

the signal commonly given by sound of trumpet to begin the'battle, or
the word called symbolum or tessera, given by the general to the soldie'rs as
a badge or mark whereby to distinguish their own men from those of the
enemy; or rather it may be taken to signify both. By imperium we are
to nnderstand the orders usually given by the general, how to behave in the
acuon.

5. Equites pedites permixti] Glareanus, says Cortius, is of opinion, that
these words are to be understood of the enemy² and that the words alios,
alios multos, denote the Romans: and Cortius himself says nothing in
opposition to this: but only adds, that, in this case, thesemi-colon or comma
placed after the word permixti, in some of the MS. and printed editions,
must be dashed out; which accordingly 1 have done3 for Ι do not see what
good sense can be made of the place, if these words be taken otherwise.
