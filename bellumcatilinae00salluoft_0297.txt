EXPLANATORY NOTES.

4. illarius Consul absensfaclus] This shows the high opinion the pcople ·

then entertained of Marius; for it was a thing exceeding rare, and very
extraordinary, nay, it was a dispens-ing with the law itself, which forbade
any one to be elected Consul in his absence, or to be re-chosen, till ten
years at least had intervened⁴

5. Kalendis „hatuariis magud glorid Consul triumphavit] This was the
year of Rome 649, and the day on which the new Consuls entered upon
their office, which was a great solemnity by itself: but as it was also the
day of the triumph, we may well suppose, that the pomp and splendour
in which Marius then appeared, was such, as abundantly justifies our
author in saying‚ Magna glorie? triumphavit. On this occasion Marius ex-
hibited a sight to the Romam, which they scarcely expected ever to have
seen, 1 mean ‚Iugurtha in chains, as we learn from Eutrop. I V. cap. xxviii.
Ante currum Marii Jugurtlza cum duobus filiis ductus est catenatus. And
Plutarch, in his life of Marius, informs us, that J ugurtha, as he waiked
in the procession, ran distracted. After the ceremony was over, he was
cast into prison; and the Lictors were so eager to seize his robe, that they
rent it in several pieces, and tore away the tips of his ears, to get the rich
jewels with which they were adorned. In this condition he was thrown
stark naked into a deep dungeon, that was to be his grave z upon going
down into which, vultu in risum verso, he uttered these words, Hercuxes,
qudm frigi. m nobis esc balneum! Here, after struggling six days with
cold and hunger, he ended his wicked life by a wretched death. Agree-
Α able to this account are the following verses subjoined to some of the old
manuscripts.

Ndsse cupis vulg& non cognita sala Juguerae,
Ue Plutarchus ait, carcere clausus obit.

6. Ed tempestate] This is said emphatically‚ and in opposition to what
followed; for, some years after this, Marius, pursuing the ambitious pur-
poses of his aspiring soul, carried matters to such an immoderate height,
as introduced the civil wars betwixt him and Sulla, which brought vast
destruction and desolation upon Rome and an Italy.
