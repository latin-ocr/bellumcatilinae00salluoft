XIr. Innocentia pro malevolentic'i] By innocentia in this place, we are to
understand abstinence from the base, oppressive, and wicked methods of ·
amassing riches, then in fashion. Such was the degeneracy of the times,
that any person who did abstain and keep himself clear from these prevail-

- ing corruptions, was thought to do so, not from a love os virtue, or prin-
ciple of integi-hy, but out of spite against, and in opposition‘to those who
fell in with them ; and that in order to cast reproach upon them and their Ι
way, and blacken their character by the lustrent* :his example. And this
1 take to be the import of the word malevolentid.
