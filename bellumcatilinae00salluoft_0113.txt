EXPLANATORY NOTES.

2. Pars hospitem] In the early ages of the world, and even in the time
of the Roman commonwealth, there being no public inns, persons that
travelled lodged in private houses, and returned the favour, when need
required, to those that entertained them. This was frequently the occasion
of a very intimate friendship be'twixt the parties, insomuch that they
esteemed and treated one another as relations. Hence the word hospes
comes to signify‚ not only a lodger or guest, but an intimate friend or ac-
quaintance3 and the word hospitium, not only lodging οι· entertainmenz,
but friendship founded upon that bottom, ancl was reckoned one of the
most sacred and inviolable ties betwixt man and man.
