EXPLANATORY NOTES.

LVI. 1. Quia fizllere nequibant]

The Romans inflicted very severe

punishments upon any desertor from them that again fell into their hands :
such as the cutting off of hands, armS, or other membms, belieading. cru-
cffixion, expo-zing to wild beasts, and the like: and therefore the terror of
torture and death, if they should fall into the hands of the Romans, at-
tached them strongly to the priuce οι· party ιο whom thoy had desertffli,
and made them stand by them in a resolute, or rather a desperate manner.
